Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community.

Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get.

I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.

Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the \"skip\" mode as following:\"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a \"skip\" mode. When a tape player's \"skip\" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it \"hears\" sound again. If your tape player has a \"skip\" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in \"normal\" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to \"fast forward\" over any silent portions of your audio feed.\"This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the \"skip\" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again.

I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple.

If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Bluetooth Phone", "unixReviewTime": 1088899200, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2004"},

The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping).

I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking \"talk me off speaker phone\", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a \"soft phone\" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on.

It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider.

The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.

It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've \"pulled your ear back\" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.", "unixReviewTime": 1200528000, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2008"},

Brown \"EB\"", "helpful": [12, 16], "reviewText": "OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High technology and lots of it w/a sluggish operation system", "unixReviewTime": 1110326400, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2005"},

I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything A Phone Should Be..", "unixReviewTime": 1111190400, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2005"},

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost Excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1143849600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2006"},

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it.

They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a \"universal\" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit.

Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called \"smart phones\" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Still among the top folding Bluetooth keyboards available", "unixReviewTime": 1302480000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2011"},

This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use \"custom\" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you \"already know\" the \"motion\" for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them!

Simicich \"Gadget Geek\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red?

The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not bad, but stick to the original", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"},

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish...

I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).

I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130.

It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason, annoying at times, but not very common.About a month after use, it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone, and voila, IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new, but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2, but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book.

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It's the service, stupid", "unixReviewTime": 1097020800, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2004"},

I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.

The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email.

Simicich \"Gadget Geek\"", "helpful": [16, 23], "reviewText": "I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Sidekick II does Almost everything....", "unixReviewTime": 1102896000, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2004"},

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 \"real\" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few \"doodle type\" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the \"hinge\" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old \"blue versions\" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new \"black face\" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the \"flash\" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, \"that thing is huge!\"..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.

For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful.

To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to \"get off your crappy Jabra BT headset\" or \"take me off your Motorola BT headset\".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a \"correct\" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent.

The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice!

Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers.

At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Sadly, I'm leaving Palm", "unixReviewTime": 1145491200, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2006"},

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought \"they aren't ready yet.\"  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.

If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.

But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.

Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very \"floppy\" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced \"speakerphone\" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call.

I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an \"upgrade phone\" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create \"categories\"  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !", "unixReviewTime": 1126828800, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2005"},

However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts.

I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing", "unixReviewTime": 1125100800, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2005"},

I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they \"fix\" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar \"basic\" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Ferrari of Mobile Phones", "unixReviewTime": 1100995200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2004"},

Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.

Allen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "If you look carefully at these so called \"bad reviews\" you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for \"Voice command\" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\"  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Look carefully at the \"bad reviews\"", "unixReviewTime": 1128643200, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2005"},

The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Razr V3 works great for me.", "unixReviewTime": 1162166400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2006"},

I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Phone", "unixReviewTime": 1125878400, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2005"},

Jarvis", "helpful": [17, 18], "reviewText": "I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've had a good experience with this phone", "unixReviewTime": 1114473600, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2005"},

The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure.

I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

{"reviewerID": "A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y", "asin": "B0006I2G3U", "reviewerName": "Steven Metz", "helpful": [32, 34], "reviewText": "Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it \"learns\" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good  headset but has its flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1144540800, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2006"},

I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks.

DesElms\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "First, I'm a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK \"3D\" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and \"hang\" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK \"3D\" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge \"respects\" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called \"s-style\" or \"s-series\" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those \"s\" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those \"s\" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those \"s\" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a \"3D\" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

So, I try this new MX505.Although I am very impress by the sound quality and unique design, it doesn't fit me too well.  Let me summarize the Pros and Cons first:Pro:Sound qualityDesign fit almost every ear type: the grey area on the ear piece is actually, soft plastic.  It makes it very easy to adjust and fairly comfortable to wear.it comes with a spare voice tubesvolumn adjustable controlCon:the cord is a little short for me, and it is around 8 cm shorter than my old MX110.  I prefer to put the phone on a further distance when I use the phone.  So, it won't bother me when I work.  If the cord is at least 30 cm or 50cm longer, it would be great.The  design doesn't fit me well... or it wouldn't wear for long comfortably.  The main reason is that it is \"soft\" plastic, not cushioned like the MX110.  Yes, it is able to clip onto the ear much better than other design.  I still feel the \"clip plain\" after wearing it for 10 min.  It is not a very painful feeling, just not very comfortable.The volumn control is good, but the build quality is not.  It uses rather cheap or thin plastic shell.  Additionally, the \"Mute\" button is not the \"soft push\" eletonic type.  It is the older switch design type, which you push to the right is \"Mute\" and push to the left is \"Unmute\".  It is rather chessy to me.My main suggestion to plantronic is that, please add the cushion on the \"ear clip\".  Secondly, please either take out the volumn control or improve it or offer longer cord.

The PowerGen charger is a little large for the inconvenient location of the accessory port in my Toyota Scion xD, and so I liked the low profile of this charger. However, from the reviews, I got the impression that this charger would not charge an Android phone at high capacity. So I also purchased aUSB Charging Cablewhose pin configuration is setup to trick an Android phone to charge in 1A \"AC\" mode. Sadly, the cable I received appears to be a standard USB data cable. However, to my surprise, the \"iPhone / iPod\" port (the top port) triggers the \"AC\" charging mode of my Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone. So in that case, I don't need any special cable. I can use the top port for my device, and my wife's iPhone charges in the bottom \"iPad / iPad2\" port.This charger extends itself about 0.25 inches (6 mm) out of the accessory port. It's much more compact than the PowerGen (which also has Apple and Android ports), but there are a few dual chargers that are a little shorter. In our car, the PowerGen has a problem that it sometimes doesn't fit well in the port and a connection isn't made without re-seating it. We were surprised by this, because the nearly identicalMediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger(which only is high capacity for Apple devices) has no trouble fitting in our car. Sadly, this BoxWave charger also sometimes loses connection and we have to re-seat it.For now, I'm happy with the device. It charges my Android phone in \"AC\" mode and appears to charge my wife's iPhone.

The headset, which I purchased online, arrived with no instructions, but did include the charger, charger cord, belt hook, and several earbuds. A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter. All functions of the headset, including vibrating ring and voice dial, work with my phone. Sound quality is generally excellent -- it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece. All bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down, precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they can't hear me. In fact, I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does. I haven't measured any run-down times, but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone, which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days. The headset is light and, for me, comfortable; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there. The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud. The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch. Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing. The rocker controls volume up and down; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up. Press the button to answer or hangup, hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on. My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently, so does the headset. The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster. An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle (unplugged, of course) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn. With practice, the headset can be put on with one hand. There is no provision for charging in an automobile, which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting. Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day. On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler.  Other than the lack of a car adapter, which can be remedied aftermarket, my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal. This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received. This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset, it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear. Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side.  The headset is rated for up to 30 meters; this does not include walls or other obstructions. Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone. Practice proves this. Lack of adjustability aside, this is a good headset with outstanding battery life.

The only problem with it is Shure's coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it. Once you understand that, you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else's.The \"problem\" with the QuietSpot--mentioned by other reviewers here--is not a failure of engineering or quality control, but one of emphasis in their documentation. Barring an actual defective unit (which will usually not work at all) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. I believe that Shure doesn't tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers. Since I have nothing to sell you, I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful. Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman's knowledge.Observation tells me that, Shure's QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does.  This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones: one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using  a trick of wiring, this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth. Since both microphones take in surrounding sound, the strongest sound that *isn't* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work, the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth. The  QuietSpot demands that you have the 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly at your mouth, and the 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth, or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case, turning the microphone head around onto its side. If the microphone-head is turned on it's side, or set too far above or below your mouth, then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it's supposed to: It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful: you have to learn to put the QuietSpot's microphone in the right place every time you put it on. Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on, you have what is close to the perfect headset. I have used the QuietSpot, standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot's noise-blocking earpiece, I could hear my listener perfectly. The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing, providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside, it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit. You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam, or with a thin-strand of wire. Once you've done this, you'll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then, it's still easy.Now that you know all this, give the QuietSpot a try.

I was quite happy with the audio quality (folks I talked to never complained about background noise, even while driving) and battery life was more than adequate.  Additionally I thought the button functions like mute, swapping calls, etc. were pretty easy to use.Why then, you ask, did you rate it only four out of five stars?  I'm glad you asked!My disappointment came when I merged my cell phone and PDA by buying a smartphone, an HP iPaq.  The headset connected to the new phone without a hitch and worked flawlessly... for a while.After anywhere from a day to a month, without any warning, the headset would cease working, refusing to connect to the phone.  The fix required hard resetting the phone every time it failed.Since hard resetting at random intervals was hardly an acceptable way to go about business, I called Motorola for support.  Without so much as a single step of troubleshooting I was told to contact the phone manufacturer, HP.Would you like to guess what HP told me?  If you guessed \"Call Motorola\", you win the cupie doll.  After calling both manufacturers repeatedly, begging for any input they could give, HP admitted that this headset was not one of a very small group of headsets specifically approved as compatible with the phone.  They added that not being on the list does not necessarily mean it won't work, after all it worked just fine for random periods of time (read: I very well could have a defective headset in my hands).Motorola's response never waivered... \"Go talk to HP.\"I knock off a star not for the very plausible prospect that the problem could lie with the phone manufacturer, but for the less than cordial attitude.  Refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck.  For all they knew, it very well could have been a defective unit but they were too quick to dismiss me to know for sure.My solution was to buy aJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged], after which I had no problems.My summary would be that this headset will likely perform beautifully with any Motorola phone.

Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.

Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900.

It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the \"smart\" keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the \"secret\". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low.

Initially, I was extremely frustrated by the phone's telephone performance and its lack of stability.  Frequent reboots, freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone.  I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone.  Over time, PalmOne has released firmware updates (the phone's operating system) that have made the phone very stable.  The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back.  This review is for the GSM Treo 650.A word about Carriers: I only use GSM because I travel abroad frequently - this limits me to Cingular and Tmobile.  I have used both, and I have found that Cingular's network coverage is more complete, especially in rural areas, but Tmobile's network sounds better.  It's a tradeoff - with Tmobile, you'll drop the call more often, but with Cingular you'll say \"what?\" more often.  Their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways.  International roaming is less expensive with Tmobile, plus Cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you've been with them for less than 6 months.  Verizon and Sprint use a cellular technology that is US-only, and therefore no good for using your phone abroad.Here are the phone's pros: in your pocket, you have your address book, datebook, notes, e-mail, low-res still and video camera, a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact, a web browser, and an mp3 player.  The QWERTY keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone.  The interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it, but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone.  Also, this phone is a quad-band GSM which means that it will work very well abroad, unlike the more common tri-band GSM phones, which don't perform as well.  (Remember, if you get a Treo Smartphone from Verizon or Sprint, it will not work abroad.)  The screen on the Palm version is brilliant.  The Windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system.  Also, GSM technology uses \"SIM\" cards, which means you can simply change out the \"SIM\" and use your phone on another network or another phone number, either domestically or while abroad.  (You might have a phone locked onto a carrier's network until your contract commitment is complete, but that's something you can sort out on your own).Here are the phone's cons: I said \"in your pocket\" because if you mount this thing on your belt, the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket.  Also, in an age of identity theft and information security, you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there.  Believe me, the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords, account information, customer information, etc.  Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant, or if it's stolen.Here are lesser cons that can be worked around: The beauty of these palm phones is that they're so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter, and they've written software to address / fix / work around the issue.  For example, I found that the phone's volume is not loud enough.  There is 3rd party volume software to fix that, as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer.  Some software is freeware, some is shareware, and some is for purchase.  The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need, and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.Thoughts about newer Treo phones:  The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out.  This is a good thing, because I don't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a \"must\".  Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface, and higher resolution camera, the phone's features are basically identical.  Also, as of the Summer 2006, the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks.  The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.Looking to the future, there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM, it will be thinner, lighter, and the antenna will be internal - basically, it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside.  These are much sought after features by Treo users.  Maybe I'll upgrade then.In conclusion, only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn't ready for market when they released it.  It's much better now; if they had initially released the current product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.UPDATE - Jan 08, 2007: the Treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the UK with Vodafone, and here in the USA, the Treo680 (Palm OS) has been announced with Cingular.  In forums on the internet, people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters), internal antenna, better keyboard, volume-too-low issue \"sort of\" resolved, better mp3 player (pTunes instead of Real), more memory, improved phone interface, EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed.  Unfortunately, the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery.  Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users).As of Thanksgiving, every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out (including Amazon).  This tells me two things: many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice, not out of necessity.  As a result, the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s, and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.Palm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person, not the power user.  I suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been.  I feel that Palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending.My recommendation: if you want a Treo, go with the 650.  With an extended battery a power user (bluetooth, e-mail, etc.) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage.  Look for it online.The smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim Motorola Q (windows), the comparably sized and feature-rich Nokia E61 (legendary stability of Symbian OS), friendlier and proven Blackberry models, the Samsung blackjack (windows), and lately the MDA (windows) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have, including Wi-Fi.The Treo does a lot - it probably has the best SMS interface on the market, but the rest is just ok.  For example, the mp3 player works, but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iRiver or iPod.  The e-mail application works, but the IMAP implementation is poor, and POP3 performance is inconsistent re: leaving or deleting messages from the server.  If you want a good e-mail application on the Treo, you'll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry.  But you will have to buy this app, and the more 3rd party apps you load, the less stable the device.  What I'm saying is the Treo is a jack of many trades but it's a master of none (except SMS/MMS messaging.)  While I am a Palm faithful, I'm afraid that if you want a *stable* phone, e-mail, address book and schedule, the blackberry is the way to go, but you won't have the bells and whistles (camera, mp3 player, 3rd party apps and touch screen) that come with a Treo.  Yes, that means I now have a crackberry.  It was a Xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my Treo.  Here is the bottom line: if you're getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money, get a blackberry.  If you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with, then you will absolutely love the Treo.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "After getting used to it, you can't live without it.", "unixReviewTime": 1157673600, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2006"},

Well I have finally become a convert.I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.Reason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.Reason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.  You want Push email?  You can get it.  You want web surfing?  No prob.  You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell?  Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).Reason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.One more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.Sure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.***UPDATE***I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)One additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).  I still think my purchase was WELL worth it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything I had hoped it would be...so far anyway...", "unixReviewTime": 1170028800, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2007"},

I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.The Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.And, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.Final note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller.

I love this thing.  It's perfect for me and my needs--personally, as well as in business.-New batteries and accessories are and will be available for years following your purchase, which means this has it all over other cell phones.-When you upgrade, all your data is transferrable even if you completely change carriers.-One program I added for instance is basically Google Earth--in my pocket!  And with memory cards in the gigabytes, I can add any and as much functionality as I care to have--plus store all my rediculous photos and other nonsense without worrying about running out of space.-I'll be using this as my mp3 player, and it's a camera that will be there even when I wouldn't have thought to bring one.-It holds all my appointments, vital information, etc . . . .-It has advantages over the super Japanese cell phones and system in that I can take longer movies and send them by regular e-mail.-When negotiating business over lunch or golf, where it would be a weak hand to bring a stack of papers or notes, you can input and look up information as need be in this device you would be expected to carry instead.-Add that I can basically use as many e-mail accounts on it as I like.This basically negates whatever need I had to carry a laptop unless I'm on an extended business trip.This is truly a computer with internet access in my pocket.  It can do all the same basic stuff a desktop computer can do.I'm only taking one star away because there are now later models even more capable, and if you're considering buying the 650 you might as well get it with faster internet access.Note that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they'll switch to the 700p to get it--so it's something to consider if you're thinking of going a step above the 650.Lastly, though I do find this increadibly handy, I don't know that it's worth the asking price that's usually listed.  If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service, the most it should cost the customer is $200 with a service contract.  There's really no excuse for charging people $500 for any phone (and I wouldn't have bought mine if it didn't cost me exactly $75 used).  They're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they'll charge you big time for breaking, so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.Cingular is currently selling these for $45 with a service contract, and I would take that deal if I weren't able to get mine for a reasonable price.  Conversely, I'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment's privacy (people I have important business with know when it's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail, and when it's not.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An increadibly all inclusive device for people who need a lot but don't want to carry a lot.", "unixReviewTime": 1160870400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2006"},

These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.Sound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.You can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.Update:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.

This solves the main purpose of the bluetooth - to enable handsfree conversation with quality audio. The voice quality is very good - people hear me very clearly and I too hear them clearly (at times, the volume seems to be a bit low but I do not know if it is because the other side is not speaking close into the phone or it is a problem with this). Pairing with the iPhone was a breeze. You can pair with 2 devices at the same time (I tried 2 phones, but I would like to add a phone and my laptop so I can take softphone calls on my laptop without an extended headset).I noticed that it disconnects from the phone after some time (less than an hour) of non-use. The first few days, I was always powering it off and on to re-establish the connection or going to the phone settings to reconnect and I was going to return it; however, one day I wanted to try pressing and holding the talk button for 2 seconds and bingo - it reconnects. So I don't have to power it off/on to reconnect.I am not sure if this is a feature of the iPhone or this device but I love the Voice Control - I press the talk button for 2 seconds to activate the Voice Control on my iPhone and I can say the number or name I want to dial and it dials for me. So now I am 100% hands-free while driving I use voice control all the time to dial people.I gave a 4 rating because this is not as comfortable as the Motorola H720 that I got for my wife (H720 is true over the ear headset - nothing going into your ear - you can read my review for that product on Amazon). Getting on the ear is a bit difficult - need 2 hands usually.For folks that want to listen to music from your iPhone/BBerry, please note that this headset is NOT A2DP enabled. i.e. you cannot stream music to your headset from your smartphone.

However, depending on how you plan to use it, it could either become a great headset or a nightmare.The first thing you notice out of the box is that it's quite large, both in the size of the battery pack that hangs over your ear and especially the depth of the microphone.  Put another way, it sticks out quite a bit from your cheek rather than laying flat against your face.  This not only can cause some sound quality issues, but also makes it very conspicuous.  So, if you prefer to keep a low profile while working hands-free, this may not be the best one for you.  The size of the piece that hangs over your ear also makes wearing glasses or even a hat an issue.  All that said, the unit is very comfortable provided you don't have anything else hooked over your ear.  It's also easily configured for either ear.Sound quality can be very good, but only in quiet environments.  Even small amounts of wind noise will render the microphone useless.  I've been surprised to have people complain to me that voicemails that I've left have been all broken up, even when I was in what I thought was a quiet place.I've also found that reception will be spotty unless the phone is placed closer than normal to the headset.  For instance, in order to maintain good signal, I typically have to have my phone in my shirt pocket.  But on the plus side, the unit is very easy to set up, with a variety of phones and PDAs immediately connecting to it with no effort.This headset would be ideal for someone who is looking to use it exclusively in an indoor office while working hands-free.  You'd get optimal sound and would be able to connect to all of your devices quickly and easily.  You wouldn't even feel self-conscious about the unit's size.  But for those on the go, its reception and microphone quality are too poor to recommend.PROS*  Excellent battery life means very little downtime for charging*  Simple to set up - instantly compatible with numerous devicesCONS*  Sound quality from the microphone, especially in places with even minimal background noise*  Big, bulky design makes fit difficult, especially with glasses or a hat", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Functional for the Right User, but Far From Perfect for All", "unixReviewTime": 1158019200, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2006"},

I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G, Motorola Razr and L6, Blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (Skype) and Playstation 3, and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.In parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250, BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510.  I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit, comfort and sound issues, so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone.  With Plantronics Voyager 510, people I talk to can't even tell I'm using a Bluetooth headset; not even when I'm driving, which I find amazing.  Since it's been over four years in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset that I constantly keep researching and reverting to this little \"mule\", I just have to give it five stars in spite of its mainly cosmetic flaws.Here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:1. Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving (windows closed). The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage. Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon.

It worked well for about 10 (maybe 12) minutes and then fell apart.  So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.Unless you consider this one.When I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).Positives:1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.On a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.  Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well.  I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.Negatives:1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.So, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.

The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item.  Other headsets may look \"sleek\", \"chic\", or more \"cool\", but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you.  If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars.  The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed.  That's the only other downside to this unit.  Otherwise, a great headset.  I enjoy mine a great deal.Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied.  The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it.  Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one.  Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam.  If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set.  Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back.  At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone.  Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions.  Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers.Another update to my previous review (September, 2010).  Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset.  The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas.  One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber \"tube\" just above the earpiece.  At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within.  This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age.  I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed.  When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset.  Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one.  But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment.Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010).  The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again.  The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago.  Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear.  Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use.  If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money.

The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage.

Further, I keep my phone's ringer on 'silent' so coworkers don't know when I receive a phone call. The headset simply beeps in my ear, and I click it to take the call. If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me, I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail. No one even knows I had a call coming! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something, I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset. They get the point pretty quickly, because they can hear the person I am talking to just about as clearly as I can!Now, if you want a nice quiet conversation in a cubical, you can scoot up close to a flat object (I use my flatscreen monitor) and talk in a very low voice. The sound reflects off of the monitor, so it is easier for your caller to hear your low voice volume without cupping your hand over your mouth piece or without trying to hold the mouth piece closer to your lips.I liked this so much I bought one for my wife. Her older phone (Motorola V557) drops the bluetooth signal much more often than mine does. Also, she goes outside more often than I do, and it seems like sunlight interferes with the bluetooth radio frequency. My wife loves keeping her phone on silent with the headset, because this way the baby doesn't wake up whenever a phone call comes in. My wife's complaint is that the signal gets dropped a lot, but she sometimes leaves the phone in the living room whenever she makes a quick trip to the bedroom - and that's just too far away.Next, I bought one for my dad.

Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls (annoying).Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.OKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.  I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background, but my voice was still clear.  Noice-cancelling is important.Pros:Clear, audible soundMic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clearWind-GuardNoise-Cancelling technology (must have!)Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)Cons:the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller (since it's rubbing against my cheek).

It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE:Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.  After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop.  I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems, but I figured it was only a matter of time before it didn't work anymore so I replaced it.

The earpieces are prone to fall out and don't stay secured after about 6 months.As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device.  I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it.  It still works!  I replaced this unit with the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I might like that even better.

I've owned a 510 for three years, this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up (literally).The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.The big strength of this headset is dealing with noise.  In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration, the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040, the 510 had the best audio in all conditions.  One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down, the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear.  Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself.  I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely, and they could hear me, but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect.  With the H710, I could hear callers well, but I was completely unintelligible to them.  The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510, but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out, as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise.  All three worked quite well in quieter environments.  The H710 fails to cancel echo (of my voice back to me) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone (with BT support).  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.I ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510.  First, it is tricky to get on and off.  It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand, and it takes some fumbling.  It's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on, but this is a hassle, and frankly looks stupid when you're doing it.  I don't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time, grabbing the attention of others around you.  I feel like I'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others.  Finally, the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket, and it's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket isn't usually workable.  Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset.  Because of its poor pocketability, I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use.  Doggie finally figured this out.For use exclusively as a car or office headset, I'd pick the 510 over all three.  But for versatility in a wider range of uses, the BT8040 works best for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Strong performer with few weaknesses", "unixReviewTime": 1214956800, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2008"},

The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset.

Before I actually bought it I did some serious testing and reading about other headsets. I've tried Jabra 250, Jabra 500, Motorola HS850 and they all had one major problem - quite static-y. Actually the HS850 was a little better in this area than the Jabra headsets. I've had Jabra 250 for almost two years - static-y big time. If I put the phone in my left pant pocket and the headset on the right ear theres' noise all the time - this is not acceptable for me. The HS850, unlike the Jabra, has poor design. Any time I turn my head sharply this thing is flabbing on my ear as if it's going to fly out at any moment. This is why I wanted something better, not the same.I went on Amazon and read reviews on all kinds of headsets and my attention stopped on the Plantronics Voyager 510 from some company I'd never heard of. The the reviews were good. Even though my BestBuy store didn't carry it I decided to make the investment, buy it online and test it in the hopes to keep it.I received my headset, hooked it up to my phone - that was easy, no problem here.Then as soon as I started using it I noticed that there was no static, almost no static. I could keep my phone anywhere around me and there would be no static - a major advantage to the previous headsets.Then I noticed how easy it is to answer phone calls with it. the answer button is large enough, right against the ear, so I just had to press it against the ear using one finger. How cool is that?! The HS850 design was like that too but the Jabra 250 needed two fingers to answer one to support the headset and the other to press the answer button - I noticed with the new Jabra 500 that wasn't an issue anymore.The Plantronics is light, easy to put on, not flabby  - wraps around your ear pretty good.There's only a few things I didn't like about it and I hope the manufacturer is listening now:1. Picks up surrounding noise. If I am out people can hardly hear what I'm saying - even if there's hardly any wind. It's so bad that I've given up on using it outside.2. The ear bud needs to be tinier. I loved the small jelly-type of earpiece that Jabra had - you could hardly feel it in your ear.3. The power button is too tiny and hard to push. Not that this is a big deal because I hardly ever need to shut down my headset but it would be nice to have one that's larger still one that's not easy to hit by accident.I didn't give this review five stars because the headset needs to do a better job at fending off surrounding noise.Other than that, I highly recommend this headset.

Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug.  So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510.  I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago.  I sometimes am in noisy environments and the \"lay on the ear\" type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises.  The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times.  Not so with the Plantronics, at least for me.  It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications.  The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume.  I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times.  Remember, I'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls, but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor.  The clarity of the sound is excellent.  The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.The headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850.  The recharge plug pushes in with a friction fit as opposed to Motorola's press to unlatch type power plug (actually its the same charger that fits many Mot phones) that ripped the guts out of my HS850.I usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it.  Folded, its slightly bigger than my previous MOT, but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850.  And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.I found the on-off button very easy to use, unlike the comments of many others.  I can very easily find the pointy button when the 510 is on my ear.

{"reviewerID": "A3BMK3DZDH0N6Q", "asin": "B0009B0IX4", "reviewerName": "TechMSS", "helpful": [15, 15], "reviewText": "I have tried a few different bluetooth headsets, always looking for the Perfect Trifecta of (in order of importance): 1) great audio transmission quality in loud environments, 2) great audio reception (i.e. loud enough, no clicks or pops), and 3) comfort. The Plantronics 510 scores 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for audio reception, but only 4 stars for audio transmission.To be fair, today's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself, or a wired headset, because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz (i.e. 8,000 audio samples per second), while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz (16,000 audio samples per second). That is why today's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.That said, as far as bluetooth goes, the Plantronics 510 does quite well -- but it has problems. I use it with my BlackBerry 8700. In a quiet environment, such as indoors or in a car with the windows up, audio transmission will be very clear. The boom mic brings the microphone closer to your mouth than do those tiny in-ear headsets, where the microphone is all the way up at your ear. (The microphone is about 3 inches from my mouth, compared to in-ear microphones, which are about 6 inches away.) The closer distance leads to a better, louder sound. However, in a noisy environment, everyone I've talked to finds it somewhat difficult to hear me because the sensitive microphone will pick up a lot of background noise. People have complained that they can hear the beeping of the checkout counter, or all the people chatting at Starbucks, or all the traffic noise, and it's hard to focus on what I'm saying. When I then disconnect the headset and talk directly into the phone, they all say, \"That's much better!\" That said, at least people can make out what I'm saying in a loud environment with this headset; with other bluetooth headsets I've used (e.g. the Motorola HS-820), loud environments render my relatively soft voice completely unintelligible.Audio reception is great when you're close to the phone; after about 5-10 feet away, you start to get clicks and pops. (Also, there are a fair number of clicks if I use the headset in my right ear while keeping the BlackBerry in my left pocket; my phone and headset need to be on the same side of my body, it seems, for the clearest sound.) The headset is very loud, and I usually listen to callers at about half-volume.In terms of comfort, Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds: small, medium, and a triangle-shaped larger one. After trying them all, I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort, and sometimes I forget i am wearing it. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand, but I soon got the hang of it. It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on. (Hint: Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger, and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger. Place the earbud in your ear, and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear. It sounds more complicated than it is, but it takes some getting used to.)I used to complain about the small power button, but then I realized that it's extremely easy to press down once the headset is on your ear. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a rocker switch; it presses down, but if you try to power on or off while not wearing the headset, it is tricky to find the right angle at which it needs to be pressed.So, bottom line: This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible, I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go, the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town, or driving. I am giving it four stars because it isn't PERFECT (and I only give five-star ratings for perfection). That said, I will continue to use it as my daily headset until the coming of the Perfect Trifecta of audio transmission, audio reception, and comfort -- which almost certainly will be achieved by Plantronics.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great bluetooth headset, with some caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1175904000, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2007"},

I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging.

Davis \"famousdavis\"", "helpful": [14, 14], "reviewText": "On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon, I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever.  I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it's designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you're turning it off.As for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn't have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that's what you want.As for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven't worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.I like the more discreet look of having the \"guts\" of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won't have a problem with it falling apart.I can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.In sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn't break, it's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works as expected - Easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1177977600, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2007"},

The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.

It's only a matter of time.  I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking:Solution #1:Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.If you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect. But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.Solution #2:Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.Materials:- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)- CA (cyanoacrylate) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore. Get the \"thin\" stuff.- Saran Wrap. yes the sandwich stuff...- ScissorsSide note: I call the nylon tape \"tape\", but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the \"tape\"1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases). Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon. It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail. Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.5) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA. Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat. This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber. The patch will have a very small profile (not that thick) and be similar in color to scotch tape, however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.There you have it. This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes. I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them. Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do. Just do it exactly in the middle of the band.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Prevent your headphones from breaking", "unixReviewTime": 1157673600, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2006"},

I got a very good deal, but the trade-off was that it came in a bag with no instructions. I went to the Logitech website and got things going.The pros:1) No wires, and the batteries last about 7 hours (I tried using them all day at work)2) The sound is good enough. (I had been using a Shure e3, which finally broke for good out of warranty). This unit is not near as loud or as bassy as the Shure, but they don't fall off while I'm on the treadmill either.3) Worked well for watching TV in private.The cons:1) Seems to need it's own bluetooth transmitter. My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable. Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.2) The headband is not adjustable and my ear feels bruised after wearing them for an hour. The time I wore them all day at work won't be repeated.The headband is almost a dealbreaker. If it wasn't for that, I'd be using these headphones all the time.3) The unit is kind of like those watches that use one button for multiple purposes. The button on each part does something different depending on how long you hold down the button. After a couple of days I got the hang of of, but the button on the transmitter is so small, that I have to stop doing anything but holding the button down to turn it off.Overall, I'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising. I can't count how many times I've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room.

No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features, but it is very disappointing as a phone.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Very disappointing phone", "unixReviewTime": 1130716800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2005"},

I bought it just to be an organizer, phone, mp3 player--in that order--so I can't speak to other features such as web access (currently an expensive $45 from Verizon).Two pieces of advice:1. Budget several hours to set up.  It's nearly like buying a new computer.  I had to transfer my calendar and contacts from my old Cli&eacute; and found that some of my old Palm applications caused the Treo to restart (I promptly deleted them). Generally it was just tedious software stuff, including a tricky firmware update from the Palm website, but don't expect to be ready out the door.2. Before you buy, budget for accessories.  After purchasing the following: case ($20), SD card reader ($10; for the easiest transfer of files to the SD card), 2GB SD card ($150), 2.5MM-compatible headphones ($17), 2.5MM>3.5MM headphone adapter ($10), extra sync cable ($13), mp3 player application ($15; the RealPlayer is clunky and doesn't have a graphic equalizer), I have nearly spent as much as the device itself!  Assuming the Treo gives me years of service, It'll be worth it but I'm going to have to live with the fear that the accessories will not be useful for my next smartphone (I rarely have replaced my cell phones because they got too old, it's normally because they stop working).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great so far but set aside time to set up; money for accessories", "unixReviewTime": 1122249600, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2005"},

It combines cellular phone, PDA, and wireless functionality, allowing you to check e-mail, surf the web, make phone calls, and keep your contacts and calendar.Be sure to buy an aftermarket USB cable, which will allow you to charge and sync your treo 650 at the same time and a headset adaptor.By downloading a few aftermarket applications (do a search on google), you can make it play internet radio, play MP3's from a 1GB SD card, play some great games, and even use it to access the internet from your laptop while on the road.  Here's what I use:1.  Directory Assistant (by Rick Whitt)-  This program allows you to easily look up and dial busines and residential telephone numbers and get driving directions and maps, without waiting as various web pages load.  I know it sounds like a silly app, and I thought so too, but I now use it all the time to avoid dialing 411 and paying $1.25 per call.  Best of all, its free (but you can and should make a donation).2.  Atom Smash by Red Mercury Software- a great arkanoid style game.3.  BackupBuddy VFS by Blue Nomad - back up the apps on your Treo.4.  Blocks by Electron Hut  - free Tetris Clone5.  ChitChat Lite - a free MSN Messenger client6.  Froggy by Tim Smith - Frogger clone.7.  Galax by Tim Smith - Galaxian clone.8,  PacMan by Horaco Ho - Duh.9.  Pocket Tunes by NormSoft - great MP3 and internet radio player.  Much better control over the audio than the included real player (which only plays MP3s, not internet radio).10.  PDANet by June Fabrics - Allows you to connect your laptop to your Treo and use the internet.  Works great.11.  FileZ by Nosleep software - your basic file manager for the Palm OS.12.  Voice Dial - download - dial calls using the sound of your voice.  Free to say numbers, but must buy to dial by name.13.  Pocket DVD Studio - allows you to compress DVD movies so that they can fit on a SD Card, making your Treo a movie player.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Make this excellent device even better", "unixReviewTime": 1125705600, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2005"},

It was a 'free' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone's camera. The Sony Ericsson's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company's demand of an extra $10 or more per month for 'web' access. But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer. It's easy, it requires no software installation and we don't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives:- eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns:- some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion: recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user, with or without a media or Internet plan.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The wire 'they' wish you didn't have", "unixReviewTime": 1247702400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2009"},

Snedigar", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of \"hello-hello? HELLO?\" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone.

See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try. The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear. The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset. I'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area. I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used. On the other end, it is important that you don't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone. However, I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes. This turns the headset on and off after pairing. You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off. If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen. I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off. Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use. I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used. I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity. I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker. The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset. However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320. I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so. I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality. Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it. Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Bluetooth Headset I've Ever Used!!", "unixReviewTime": 1155859200, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2006"},

It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so, some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound, music, wind, or cars nearby.

This let me and the caller compare the sound quality equally from both sides of the call. In a nutshell, the Jabra BT500 wins on function and the Plantronics 510 wins on sound quality. Given that background noise is such a big issue for me, I have to go with the 510. The BT500 has better designed buttons that both feel and work better. But, the sound problems are: 1) The BT500 always sounds slightly more muffled, even in a quiet environment 2) The BT500 has the mic so close to your face that it often touches and makes noise, especially when trying to use a button and 3) in a noisy environment the Plantronics 510 wins hands down. With the kind of background noise I get, I couldn't use the Jabra BT500. I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound.

Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star...  I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great.

Allen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Oct 7th 2005If you look carefully at these so called \"bad reviews\" you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you dont, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\" I'm in total agreement with \"Harry G from TN\" the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, but like Harry mentioned make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.(Update 4/30/06.)Well 7 months later and these phones are still working flawless with ZERO problems of anykind.I charge it maybe twice a week so battery life is still great.Neither my wife or I have this alleged sound problem some seem to have the earpiece and speakerphone volume are plenty loud.My wife is constantly playing solitaire on hers, so she has worked the hell out of that keypad the last 7 months and no problems.These phones are the best we have ever had by far, so like I said before take these \"bad reviews\" with a grain of salt.Some may indeed have a faulty unit which is going to happen regardless which phone you buy, but I bet a large percentage of these problems are simply operator error.These phones are excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.Still the only slight fault that I can gripe about on them is the screen is hard to see in bright sunlight.and it took an extra couple weeks to get rebate but was no problem, just a single phone call and problem was solved.(Update June 23th 2006)Have had these phones over 9 months so far without a single problem, they work flawless.As I said above anyone giving this phone a bad rating either has that rare bad one of the bunch or simply doesn't know how to use the phone. I have dropped this phone 3X so far, last time was 4 days ago in the parking lot on concrete and no problems at all, not even a scratch. (Of course the Krussel case is outstanding and helps a lot)We used both our phones while on a Cruise to the Caribbean and as long as we were in an area/Island that had cell service we had good reception and no problems at all, and as long as we were in a US territory (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John) the calls were not roaming.You get the phones for FREE, Amazon is good to order from with no problems, Cingular so far for us anyway have been very good and the service (in our area) is far better than what Alltel was.There may be some phones out there as good, some im sure will have a better camera, however I seriously doubt you will find a better all around cell phone & service.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Look carefully at \"bad reviews\"", "unixReviewTime": 1128643200, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2005"},

Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function.  For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off.

The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary.So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup.

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "helpful": [25, 32], "reviewText": "I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar \"Please say a command\" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting \"Please say a command\".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts \"Comfort\" and \"Ease of Use\".  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after, though, I would not buy it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Doesn't Deliver On Its Potential", "unixReviewTime": 1143590400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2006"},

Contrary to what some people have said, it *does* simultaneously connect with a phone and PC. I am using a Treo 700p PDA phone and a Lenovo X60 Thinkpad with integrated Bluetooth. If it doesn't do that for you, it is most likely a driver/SW problem with your phone and/or PC. It takes two to tango and people are all too ready to blame the headset when it is just as likely to be a problem with their source.When I'm listening to music I have stored on my X60 it plays the music well and the controls all work with Windows Media Player. If I get a call, the music will pause and I can take the call on my Treo. When I end the call, the music resumes. The sound quality is decent. It's not audiophile quality, but if you want that from a $70 wireless headset, your head is screwed on wrong. It's certainly good enough for what I want it for which is casual listening while I'm working.One big plus is that the HT820 stays connected to my Treo 700p much better than my Plantronics Discovery 640. With the 640, the headset always drops the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a call. The 640 does this with my Treo 100% of the time. I am reasonably sure it is a problem with the Treo's BT so it is technically not the fault of the 640, but the HT820 appears to handle the Treo BT problem much better.A few issues I have:1) My biggest problem is that the rubber that goes over the ears has a bit of a harder edge than I would like and after a little while it gets somewhat uncomfortable. I'm going to try a little moleskin from the local Walgreen's to see if that helps.2) The sound quality of the microphone is just so-so. My friends that hear me on the other end of my calls say it sounds somewhat muffled compared to my Plantronics 640. They can still clearly hear me and understand what I'm saying, but in a relative comparison the 640 has a better sound detection circuit.Finally, I do get occasional dropouts on my music, but I know it is the BT software on my Treo again. I can see that when the Treo drops the BT connection, the HT820 tries repeatedly to reconnect and the music from my PC gets spotty until it connects and then it's fine again. The other times I get dropouts is when the X60 is doing something fairly processor intensive. I guess audio is considered low priority in the software and is one of the first things to get put on hold.As others have mentioned, there is a noticable lag in the audio when you are watching video or playing games. This is expected because of the extra encoding/decoding step that has to happen when you send it digitally over BT and then the headset has to decode it again. I would say BT headsets in general are best for listening to pure audio since there is nothing visual to be in sync with. They are OK for video if you can deal with the slight delay in the sound. It kinda looks like those old kung fu movies where peoples' mouths will move slightly ahead of when you hear what they are saying. Any BT headset is going to have this issue until they come out with software and system design changes that compensate for it.I have tried it with some games and they are OK for turn-based games like Galactic Civilizations where the audio is not crucial to the game action. However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up. Gotta stick to low-tech analog headsets for that.Overall, it is very good but not perfect.

I read a lot of reviews and found as much information as I could about this before even ordering it.  And after reading very mixed reviews, I just had to find out for myself.So here it is:I use it with my Motorola Q, which is also not a bad phone, and it works perfectly fine with it.  It paired up without any problems and stays connected when you want it to stay connected.  I have not had the opportunity to really test out the battery life yet, but I have tested it for approx 2 hours in between charges and it holds up fine for 2 hours.Incoming sound quality is perfect.  Actually a little too loud, but you can just lower the volume.Outgoing sound is also much better according my girlfriend who has heard me on my previous Sony HBH-660, and she says that the sound quality is much better.  Even when I have my windows rolled down going 65, she says she can hear me fine, although she says it sounds like I have the faucet running.  So I do question how the DSP itself works since it doesn't really filter out the windnoise.The system itself is pretty sleek and gives you multiple charging options.  So there should be no worry of running out of battery unless you talk consistently for more than 3 hours at a time.One gripe I do have is the button and the plastic.  The button should be easier to press and should require as much pressure as it does.  The plastic seems kind of cheap, which is probably what makes the thing so light, you barely even notice you have it on. So they should have use better plastic with better chrome paint that doesn't scratch or chip off.Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up and the best headset I have used so far.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headset in a not so great package.", "unixReviewTime": 1152489600, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2006"},

I pair it with my RAZR and Uniden's cordless ELBT595.  I've been highly pleased with it's performance.BLUETOOTH PAIRINGThis was extremely easy and handled through the one master button at the top.  Hold it down until it flashes red and it will pair with your phone.  Answer calls by pushing the button, and hang up by pushing the button.  Simple as that.  I've gotten consistent call quality within a range of 10 feet from the phone, and haven't experienced any interference from WiFi networks.VOLUMEI think the biggest problem with bluetooth headsets is that they are not loud enough.  I tried several different bluetooth headsets that my friends have, most noteably the Motorola HS850 and H700.  Those work well but I still have a hard time hearing people when I'm driving in a car, or there is a low level of ambient noise in the background.  The greatest feature of the Plantronics 640 is that it fits in your ear, and is therefore probably twice as loud as any other headset I've tried.  I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.  You can also mute the headset by pushing the up and down volume buttons simultaneously.COMFORT/FITI was skeptical about the fit of this headset.  I never liked earbud headphones (think iPod) as they fail to stay in my ears whenever I have to move around.  That's why I was astonished that the Plantronics 640 stays in my ear without any problems.  And it is very comfortable as I've worn it for periods over 1 hour and have not had any irritation.  Since it fits in your ear, and not over it, you can easily wear sunglasses with it (great for driving).  If I know I'm going to be highly active while wearing the headset, I will put the optional over-the-ear clip on it, but for most instances it is not necessary.DESIGNThe 640 is small and light, and stylish enough for me.  The headset comes with a bevy of attachments and a carrying case.  The headset fits into a \"pen-clip\" holder that serves two purposes.  First, you can carry your 640 in your shirt pocket if you wish (and look extremely nerdy I might add).  But the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset.  Put the headset into the pen clip and you can now charge it with the included AC adapter, or you can add one of the extra attachments to the pen clip so that you can use your phone's charger to also charge the 640.  Almost all phone types are supported.  There is also a AAA battery adapter that can link up to the pen clip and be used to charge your 640.  The battery life of the headset itself is great; I've talked on it for about 5 hours and the headset still didn't die.PROBLEMSThere are few and they're nit-picky ones.  It's unfortunate that the adapter to use the RAZR's mini-USB phone charger to charge the 640 is not included.  You can buy one off eBay for under $20, though.  The pen clip adapter is ok, but not the absolute best way to carry your 640 around.  It fits in any pocket, and protects the mic, but does not cover the earbud side of the headset.  Therefore, I usually carry the 640 in the small case it comes with.  But this case holds ALL the attachments and it would be nice if there was something smaller to transport the headset alone that protected the entire headset and was smaller than the full case.  Some people have also complained that the mic picks up lots of ambient noise.  I find this to be the case of all headsets, bluetooth or corded.  If you're in a crowd, people are not going to be able to hear you on your cell phone or bluetooth headset--they are going to hear the crowd.  I believe there is a new 645 model that has some noise-cancellation features, but that is done with digital software processing, not filters physically sitting on the mic.OVERALLI don't think the perfect bluetooth headset has been produced yet.  But I'm giving this one 5 stars because as of June 2006 this one is reliable and is undoubtably the loudest headset out there.  My hearing is just fine, but if the volume on your headset or cell phone is the biggest sticking point with you, then this is probably the best headset you can get.  If you can get this headset for $80 or less, I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best bluetooth headset I've tried", "unixReviewTime": 1149638400, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2006"},

They even give you a mirror on the back of the case (I guess so you can see how cool you look with the headset).  Out of the box, it's easy to setup.  Took about 1.5 hrs to charge the headset.Pros:  This headset is light, small, and well designed.  The ear gel isn't intrusive like the old Jabras.  I would say it's like an earphone that you would use for mp3s, except it's made out of rubber which is good so it won't slip out.  they give you 2 other gels if the default doesn't fit.  I have a small set of ears, and the default is perfect.  It pairs easily with my LG PM 325 (Sprint Phone).  I don't notice a difference between this and my old Logitech in terms of sound quality, meaning the quality is excellent.  They heard me, I heard them, it was clear, no static.  If you DO get static it's just the downfall of BT technology (wi-fi, walls, or microwave interference).

This would be a great feature to have since it's so mobile, and wouldn't it be better if we could use it outdoors?  Foam isn't that expensive to add...

Then I went on the web to see if I had some compatibility issue. It then occurred to me that I might have actually gotten a bad piece of electronics - which is a pretty rare occurrence nowadays.

I am directly involved in the semiconductor testing industry and have been for many years. Bluetooth chips, and many other relatively low cost consumer semiconductor devices, are NOT fully tested. Instead, the lots of devices are sample tested to statistically insure that a very high percentage are \"good.\" This is in direct contrast to higher value chips, such as Intel, AMD and PPC microprocessors, that are much more fully tested at multiple steps. The low cost nature of bluetooth chips (as well as many mp3, 802.11, etc.) really mandates the sampled test approach. For the most part, we get away with it. In the case of the unit I bought, it was not sufficient. The fact that I got a defective finished headset means that it is unlikely that Plantronics does 100% testing of its finished headset in addition to the known fact that the IC manufacturer they use is unlikely to do 100% testing. Once again, check it before you leave the parking lot.I will try one of these again as soon as they are back in stock and report on it again if I get a functional unit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Check before leaving store", "unixReviewTime": 1132358400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2005"},

While Motorola phones to come equipped with a voice recorders, the amount of memory that one is allowed to use for voice records is very limited.  With this phone, I can compose many short notes to myself, such as what items to buy from the grocery store, whom to call, what the license plate number was of the person who hit my car, etc.The phone's camera is also adequate for my purposes.  However, I'm not a big photo taker.  I have used the phone to document damage to my car (after I had a broken car window, for example).The data cable and free software pack is that you can download from Sony's website allow you to transfer images and sounds to and from the computer with relative ease, free of charge.One annoying feature of the phone: it takes a non-standard headset, charger, and data connection cable.  So, you cannot use handsets equipped with standard 2.5 mm connectors. unfortunately, I have not found a very good Bluetooth headset that works well with the phone.  So, one's best bet is to use the standard headset that comes with the phone.as previous reviewers have commented, the phone's screen does blank from time-to-time.It is difficult to use the voice-activated dial feature.  Recognition is very poor with this phone.  Motorola phones, in general, have slightly more sophisticated voice-activated dial features.It is also fairly easy to record conversations using the voice-recorder feature.

You can simply record the needed information and playback.  I often use this feature when I'm calling restaurants or merchants for addresses, telephone numbers, or directions.I've found that battery time is generally quite good.As with all cell phones, make sure you determine what features you want in advance, do your research, and purchase a phone that has all the features you want.I, for instance, am most interested in the voice-recorder that this flip phone is equipped with. I can live with the phone's other deficits.I would suggest going in to one or more stores to make the purchase, if possible.

First, the good: the mount is solid, it stays stuck to the glass, and the flexible arm bit is VERY stiff and hard to adjust but really stays put once you have it where you want it. Now, the not so great: the flexible arm seems to vibrate quite a bit while you drive, and the expanding bracket does not work as well as promised. In fact, the button on the side only seems to open the bracket if you have it rotated 90 degrees to the left (as in landscape, with the button pointing up). I took it apart and realized that this is because there is an assortment of rather cheap gears which rely on gravity to allow the button to only work in one direction.

MP3s can also be used as ringtones. all-in-all, no complaints here! well, except the 256MB limit.radio: nice little feature! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio, as it acts as the antenna, but while it's plugged in, you can send the sound to come out of the speakers. radio is easy to use, channels are easy to store and radio sounds good. the radio (as well as the MP3 player), will pause if you get a call and resume when you're done. you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone. headphones sound awesome.games: the phone came with six games: asphalt3D, blockbreaker, bruwnswick billiards, jewel quest, name that tune, tetris, and 3D extreme air snowboarding. all games are locked, so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them. they are $6-$8, roughly. total rip off. thanks cingular.ringtones: again, thanks to cingular, there are only six ringtones that come with this phone, and they are pretty crappy. there are free ones all over the place, so don't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular. or, do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth. there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones. kinda cool. i've made a few so far and they aren't bad. well, ok, my mom said they sounded horrible, but what does she know?syncing: this phone syncs with your contacts, tasks, notes and calendar, if you have those kinds of programs on your PC. i got my phone to sync with my outlook, which now means i'll sell my PDA. SE's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy. however, it seems like every now and again, when i am connected via USB, it reboots my phone. don't know what that's about. i don't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand, weight-wise. i've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life, and while it's not the most convenient to \"flip\" open, it's not bad. you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut, too, which i liked.it seems like SE didn't leave anything out with this phone (except a memory slot) and i love it. they thought of everything on this phone: radio, little flash light, dedicated key lock button, infrared, calendar, music/video/picture DJ,stopwatch, timer, tasks, notes and the list goes on and on. the phone's styling (ie: orange cover) isn't for everyone, but i love it. my phone did come with a 2nd cover, in navy blue. it's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad. it's definitely a head-turner.and, above all, reception and clarity of calls is great. i've had no complaints when i've used the phone, the headset, the bluetooth headset and speakerphone. it's really nice. this of course, can be dependent on your network. i live in the midwest in a fairly large area (260K people), so we have cell towers all over the place.pros:* nice size.* bluetooth, infrared and speakerphone.* radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent. reception is great.* screen is nice and bright.* easy to get pics, vids, etc. on and off the phone.* phone comes with everything you need (except car charger)* this phone is loaded - nothing is left out!* sony ericsson's interface is great; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info. menus are easy to use.cons:* no memory slot. on-board memory, while not bad, is limited to 256MB.* price (well, at full retail anyway).* camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP.* phone goes into standby (screen off) after 15 seconds. very annoying and to date, i've found no way to change that.* games are locked for only 1 minute of play. thanks cingular ;( not ONE free game is included.* keypad buttons are small, and close together. i have small hands, so the key size is not so bad, it's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone. its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory, but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500, this phone will suit you just fine. i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months (which is about how often i get a new cell phone) - it has everything i need and nothing i don't. kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone! woo! ;)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best phone i've owned. seriously. it rocks. go buy it. :)", "unixReviewTime": 1133740800, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2005"},

I really didn't need an MP3 player as I usually carry a PDA with me as well, but the features on this phone were just too good to pass up. I considered a Motorola RAZR but saw a lot of complaints about battery life. Well, no problems here! I've previously been using a SE T616 which had superb battery life, and this phone is equally as good. Which is certainly important if you do plan to use it as a music player.First things first...entering phone numbers. So tedious on most phones, and something I always dread. Thankfully, the W600i came with software to sync with Outlook. It took me a little while to figure out the syncing software. When you hook the phone up to USB, it can go into phone mode or file mode and for some reason the software always tells me it can't find the phone if it is in file mode. So to sync, I had to put it in phone mode. Turns out file mode was used only for transferring MP3s. Still tells me it can't find the phone, yet the transfer did work! Sometimes when I plug it in, my computer won't see it without rebooting, which cost me a lot of time and aggravation trying to figure out as well. So somewhat annoying implementation here, but such a time saver, and something I've never had before at all with a phone, so it's hard to gripe. I usually don't bother to put appointments and tasks on my cell phone, but since they just sync with Outlook, now that's easy to do as well. This may not be a SmartPhone, but it could replace a PDA for casual users.The MP3 player is decent enough. Sound quality was much better than I expected. Then I tried the built-in FM radio. Wow, awesome reception here! The cord acts as an antennae so you have to be sure to unwind it for best results, but considering how far from the stations I am, I was quite impressed with how nice it sounded. Some simple equalizer settings, nothing special. Only gripe would be the lack of an external memory card, there's certainly room for one so it should have been added. I guess Sony's proprietary Memory Stick would be large to squeeze in, so rather than add a SD slot, they just left it out completely. Booo to that.Phone data features worked great. I got even better reception on the W600i than my T616 and now also have Edge. Had no problems using Bluetooth to connect up to my PDA and laptop, and speeds were pretty nice. The Media Net services worked fast and there were some nice demo services included as well. Not sure I will pay for these but definitely worth considering.Camera is better than most cell phone cameras I have used, but still nothing great. The pseudo-flash is at least an attempt to improve indoor shots but any real camera still beats the pants off it. You can even use the little flash-light as an SOS beacon if you get lost. ;-) Even better is the image import included with the PC software. Was nice to easily copy over GOOD photos to use for my contacts.To use the keypad, you have to swivel the back of the camera down. It makes a cool little sound and lights up, but it's not the easiest motion to do one-handed and will also make getting a decent playthrough case a lot harder than other phones. The buttons are easy to press though, an improvement over my old T616. There are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen that confused me as to their function (of course, I don't bother with manuals!) I did figure out that they were used when playing games in landscape mode. Neat idea. There were a couple bugs in the OS as well. When using voice dial, an misrecognized command results in a really weird and annoying sound coming from the phone. And the voice command symbols in the address book are very buggy...appearing and disappearing from the contacts that don't have them. Hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these.This is the first cell phone I've had with a real speakerphone. You really can use it without having to hold it up to your ear...assuming you are someplace it won't disturb other users. You can play music through the speaker as well, and use those MP3s as alarms and phone sounds, so lots of things to play with here. For some reason a lot of the phone tones you can buy through Cingular are not available for this phone yet, but hopefully they will get those working soon. I also had trouble downloading a couple games I purchased.Some users have reported issues with using bluetooth headsets, particularly with voice control. I'm not a fan of having another device I have to charge all the time, so I prefer using a regular handfree. And this phone actually comes with one for free! The headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the FM antennae, so it's well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset, IMO.I was able to get both my PDA and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection, although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working. Great speed difference with the Edge network! According to Windows, I was getting 400Kbps, with my old phone it was usually around 100Kbps. The phone has a nice \"E\" symbol that tells you when you are on Edge, and \"G\" for regular GPRS. Even in my house out here in the country I am able to get Edge, which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't traveled much yet, but it looks like they already have pretty good coverage, and metro areas in particular shouldn't be an issue.So, this may not be the smallest, lightest phone out there. There are definitely some issues like the weird swivel design, voice dial bugs and lack of memory card support that may be cause for complaint. But if your priorities are a phone with great battery life, excellent reception, Edge and bluetooth, and easy to use, this one should definitely be at the top of your list. If you don't already have  a portable MP3/FM player, I don't see how you could even consider anything else! I've yet to find the perfect phone, but this one comes so close to it and is so much better than the other phones I've had, I have to give it 5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best phone I've owned!", "unixReviewTime": 1135209600, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2005"},

At least I was able to keep my number and swap the old SIM into the new phone.Overall I'm fairly happy with the 8700c. I miss the five-way joystick: navigating in Google Maps is a bit awkward. (Alt+scrollwheel for side-to-side). The keyboard is OK, but \".\" should have a dedicated key. I find the phone sound OK, although some people that I call report high noise levels.The biggest issue is switching between silent/vibrate and ring modes. The Treo gets this right: there is a simple, easily visible, sliding switch. You can see instantly what mode you're in, and can switch into silent mode without even removing the Treo from its holster.On the Blackberry I have to unlock it (using my password) and get back to the main menu screen just to SEE what mode I'm in (interpreting a small multicoloured icon). If I need to switch modes I then have to scroll to the Profiles applet, select it, choose the right profile, and apply it - a total of 15-20 key presses and wheel scroll events.  This simply sucks. Since I try to be polite and avoid phone interruptions during meetings, I wind up leaving the device on vibrate only, which means that occasionally I miss a call.RIM really needs to fix this. I can't imagine that anyone else has patented the idea of a \"mute\" switch....UPDATE, 2/10/07: The usability issues that I mentioned, plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me.

It does a great job of retrieving email from all five of my accounts, and functions well as a phone and PDA. I am thrilled.Until two weeks ago, I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability, and a cell phone. I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour. Prior to getting this Blackberry, I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim, stay tied to my laptop, or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone. It was terrible.Now with the Blackberry, all of my email accounts are programmed in so I'm instantly notified when I get a message. Because I can respond within seconds, I never miss a beat. My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs, which they love. The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly. I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly. I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.Additionally, I love the fact that I can synch my MS Outlook calendar, contacts, address book, tasks, etc. to the Blackberry. (It also has the ability to synch with other PIM programs.) I have mine set to sound an alarm 15 mins before I'm due in a meeting or appt and it has been a life saver. When you are always on the go, it's easy to forget stuff. This Blackberry makes it easy to keep everything in one place. Oh, and surfing the web is a breeze. The display is a nice size and it's crisp and clear and shows almost all websites easily.Lastly, I love the size of the 8700. I thought it would be a bit bulky but it's not. This version is about the same size as the 7290 Blackberry and fits nicely in your hand.My only two complaints are that some of the buttons and functions are not immediately intuitive, and RIM has yet to come out with an assortment of cases for this version. But, after about 15 mins of playing around, I was able to figure out just about everything (the manual that RIM provides covers only the basics), and I found a great case on eBay.I only wish I had discovered Blackberry sooner!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Blackberry!", "unixReviewTime": 1138233600, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2006"},

One the screen is moved up to the surface of the phone(not indented).  The screen also is smoothed out and extends to the top of the phone.

Its not the fact that its grey but the fact that the actual case is black but painted grey.  So cany scratch or dent will show black on the grey case.  Makes it stand out more.  I have dropped and beat up my 7290 so much but none of this really shows. If you are new to blackberry or have to buy another one this 8700c is it.

However, they are very different, particularly in their strengths and weaknesses --- my review is based upon how well each smartphone handles the following things -- PHONE FUNCTIONS- EMAIL- INTERNET- PHOTOGRAPHS- MULTIMEDIA (Music & Movies)- SPEAKERPHONE- BLUETOOTH- COMPUTER SYNCHRONIZATION- MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)Okay..... here we go -1. PHONE FUNCTIONSFor me, the Treo 700p has much better phone functions --- this is mostly because of their touch screen capabilitiesWhen I wanna dial a number off of the Treo, I immediately start spelling the person's name on the keyboard, and I immediately go to my phone book, where I can touch the number I want to dialThe BlackBerry is a bit more complicated, as I cannot touch the screen --- therefore, I'm limited to dialing based upon scrolling to the right name and then pressing the numberOverall, the BlackBerry isn't bad ---- however, I know a lot of people like to use their phone while driving their car (with a bluetooth headset on) or like to use the phone in situations that require a quick reaction.... if you wanna use your phone in the car, then the Treo is the best choice, mainly because the touch screen allows one to go to any name and dial immediately --- as funny as this sounds, you can really only use a BlackBerry, for phone calls, in situations when you can give it total devotionWith that said.... if you are not dialing numbers while driving in the car, then the BlackBerry's phone functions are fine.... they take a bit longer to get going, due to scrolling.... but they get the job done just fine (and yes, you can use the keyboard to look up names in the address book, as well)2. EMAILOkay - this is really the only category where the BlackBerry really beats up the Treo 700 and beats it up GOOD!!!First off, email on the Treo 700p is no totally useless.... the Treo comes with VersaMail, a program that handles all POP, IMAP, and other email accounts with ease..... there's also a program available called CHATTER EMAIL for the Treo, which makes the Treo's email functions even faster and more versatileHowever, the big problem with Treo email is that one has to download the email --- in other words, you have to log onto ChatterMail or VersaMail and wait for a few mins as the program downloads all of the email you've received --- now you can configure a program like ChatterMail to be constantly downloading your email, so one receives it immediately, however this is a BAD choice because such a function basically keeps the Treo on a 'constant' phone call, as it downloads email --- in turn, your cell phone mins get eaten up, battery life goes down quickly, and phone calls are missed do to your phone being occupied on the 'other line'THe BlackBerry, on the other hand, downloads all of your emails immediately, without draining the battery, without interrupting phone calls, and without eating up your cell phone mins --- my BlackBerry can download my emails more immediately than my own laptopIn addition, the BlackBerry 8703 keyboard is absolutely awesome --- so I much more prefer to write emails over my BlackBerry than I do over my Treo 700pIn summary on this one, the BlackBerry is clearly much better with email.... and if email is the most important thing to you, then go BlackBerry for sure! --- however, the Treo 700p holds its own with email, provided that you are willing to wait and download your emails over something like Chatter or Versamail3. INTERNETBoth phones handle internet similarly, however, I would give the edge to the Treo 700p mostly because of the TOUCHSCREEN, as it allows one to navigate webpages with more freedomThat said, the BlackBerry is fien too, just a bit more limitedBoth phones can connect your laptop to the internet, depending on your cell service --- I've been very pleased with the Treo's ability to connect my laptop to the internet, provided that I use its USB cable with the program USB MODEM ----- I don't have as much experience doing this with my BlackBerry, but I have heard that the results are favorable when doing soEVDO speeds on both phones are very good4. PHOTOGRAPHSIf pictures are important, then the Treo 700p is the CLEAR winnerThe Treo 700p comes with a great multimedia program, fueld by an embedded Kinoma player, which can allow you to show off pictures with pretty good easeI'm a Mac user, so I use MarkSpace to get my pics onto my Treo and I'm very pleased with the Treo's ability to show off pictures --- the resolution and quality are shown off very wellI have yet to get pictures onto my BlackBerry though --- I have seen other friends of mine show off pictures on their BlackBerry, but the program does not seem as sophisticated or as user friendly as Palm'sClearly, the Treo 700p is made to handle pics, whereas the BlackBerry is lagging in this area5. MULTIMEDIA (Movies/Music)I am actually DEEPLY impressed with how well the Treo 700p can handle multimedia, both music and moviesI am a filmmaker myself --- with the use of the program, KINOMA PRODUCER, I have compressed many of my short films to small files, for the purposes of showing them off of my Treo to some friends --- the Treo 700p plays the files excellently, with sound coming out of the speakerphone and the resolutions of the films looking excellent!Even better is that the Treo 700p can handle MP4's and MPEG4's, allowing me to encode the best resolution and best sounding files onto my Treo ---- sadly, the Treo 700p cannot play songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store, as those are copyright protected, but it will play anything that one encodes with my own devicesThe music/mp3 player on the Treo is also excellent, playing tunes through the speakerphone, or through the headphones that the Treo comes withAs far as I can tell, the BlackBerry 8703 does not have any multimedia functions, so good luck getting an MP4 or MPEG4 onto this thing ---- however, Blackberry is working on this, so future BlackBerry's will have this capability --- but if playing movies and music is important to you, then the Treo 700p is the only choice in this departmentLastly - important to include that the Treo 700p also has a built in camera and a built in camcorder --- and the camcorder movies taken on the Treo are actually pretty good quality! --- the BlackBerry 8703 has no camera and no camcorder6. SPEAKERPHONEThe Speakerphone on both phones is excellent and easy to use, with both being loud and clearIf speakerphone is your main buying point, then you couldn't go wrong with either phone7. BLUETOOTHBluetooth is very solid on both phonesI've been especially pleased with the Treo 700p, whose BlueTooth capabilities are much more solid and stable than the old Treo 650pThe BlackBerry seems to have few problems connecting with my bluetooth headset and other devices ---- I would say that both phones boast great bluetooth capabilities8. COMPUTER SYNCHROIt's important to note that I have a MAC and I sync all my phones off of my MacFor the Treo 700p, I use MarkSpace's Missing Sync, as Palm's software is terribleFor the BlackBerry, BB has launched free Mac-Syncing software, that can be found on their websiteSyncing any smartphone off of a Mac is never an easy thing and I've not been too happy with the processWith that said, I'm pleased with MarkSpace's Missing Sync as, for the most part, the program does a good job of syncing my Treo's contacts and calendars, as well as doing photos and music --- unfortunately, the syncing process seems to take forever (usually at least 35 mins) but syncing once a week isn't a big dealI was pleased with how well the BlackBerry synced to my Mac, however, none of the email addresses for my contacts have transferred --- so there are some kinks to work out, and it could be that I'm just not syncing it rightMain point - both phones sync fine with the Mac, but expect some minor probs --- however, for what its worth, I'm pretty satisified overall9. MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)It is important to note that the BlackBerry is MUCH MORE stable than the Treo 700p --- I have had my BlackBerry shut down on me once in the last few months, whereas the Treo 700p probably shuts down once a weekSo if stability is important, than the BlackBerry is the way to goThe calendar and address book functions of both phones are excellent, but I would say that the Treo 700p's PDA functions are a 'bit' betterBoth phones are fine with text messaging, as well--- CONCLUSION ---If I could only use ONE of these phones, then I would definitely pick the Treo 700p --- the reasons why are because the multimedia functions very much impress me, as I like to store some pics and movies on thereIn addition, the phone functions are easier to navigate and the touchscreen is something that I couldn't live without on a daily basis --- text messaging, bluetooth, and PDA functions are all excellent, as well, with email being the only thing that lags (but even that's not so bad)However, I love the BlackBerry's solid system and its excellent email performanceHaving one as my personal cellphone and the other as my business setup is the perfect balance --- however, I would give the slight edge to the Treo 700pWith that said --- if you want multimedia and other phone functions, in addition to better phone functions, then the Treo 700p is your phoneIf you are all business and clearly value EMAIL over multimedia, then the BlackBerry may be your best betHope that helpsPEACE AND LOVE & HAPPY BUYING!!!!Muhammad Ali Hasan", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Ultimate TREO vs BLACKBERRY review!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1167091200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2006"},

I don't use my Bluetooth earpiece often, so when I did go to use it, the soft foam just crumbled in my hand.  I was irritated with myself because I had no idea where to get a replacement foam covering.I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue!  When I found this foam replacement set, I was delighted because buying it would address another, nagging problem I've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation.  So, buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom, too.Putting on the eartip cover was tough because it's a TIGHT fit, and you wonder if you're going to tear the eartip in the process (I didn't).  Putting on the windscreen on the speaker boom was not as difficult, but it also was a tight fit.  I did have the speaker boom windscreen fall off once when I was transporting the headset around in my pocket.What's really nice is that still have left-over pieces to this set that I can do another repair job in the future (as long as I remember where I stowed these pieces!).Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "TERRIFIC product to repair my Plantronics Bluetooth headset", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"},

There are a lot of Bluetooth heasets to choose from on the market today.  Many are more stylish and have more bells and whistles, but for under $30.00 this headset is one of the best values out there.  This pink version is very cute and offers a perfect color match for the Versizon V3 series Motorola Pink Razr.  However, I believe the gentle pink color is the only stylish element of this headset.  Take away the pink and you are left with a very generic looking earpiece.Now lets talk about performance.  The H500 couldn't be eaiser to use.  It paired with my daughter's Verizon Motorola Pink Razr in just seconds, and the button configuration of this unit makes perfect sense.  The buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying \"click\" feel when pushing them; not mushy feeling at all.  The sound quality of the speaker is quite good but not acceptional.  The voice quality of the microphone is very impressive.  When I am on the phone with my daughter, she actually sounds much better with this headset than when using the Razr phone alone.  It does tend to pickup a great deal of background noise though, so it may not be the best in noisey environments.  The H500 sits in a very stable manner on my daughters ear.  The ear hook is soft and flexible and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort.  It does not look or feel as if it will fall off your ear even when tipping your head.I am giving this headset a full 5 stars.  I do not rate the H500 so highly for its outstanding style, but rather for its simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality and overall value for the money.  You just can't get a better Bluetooth headset for under $30.00!  I highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a cute color match to her Verizon Moto Razr, while also seeking a comfortable fit and impressive performance.

I think that the charger compatability should seal the deal for RAZR users--in my opinion, this is definitely the Bluetooth headset to get if you have a RAZR.The only negative is that the manual, like the manual for my RAZR phone, is imcomplete. For instance, although the container says that you can pair with up to eight devices, I could not figure out how to pair with additional devices, nor how to switch between devices. I wish Motorola would invest in the writing and production of proper manuals--or at least to make the full manual accessible on the web, if they don't want to clutter the manual for most people with features most folks won't use.Oh...and I'd also like to be able to wear the thing without having to put it in Standby mode...but given how little energy Standby mode uses, that's not a really big deal.

I choose to wear it without the hook because it fits better into my ear but I'd never ride my bike or do any sudden movements without the hook.- It's so light that I don't feel it if it falls off- For the above reasons I definitely don't recommend it for sporty and fast moving individualsBottom line: Nice and fashionable set for people who don't move much and won't use it outside or in noisy areas.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice, but not for noisy environments or sports", "unixReviewTime": 1180828800, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2007"},

SOUND QUALITY OUTBOUND --- I called my own voicemail and talked into it, while wearing this headset --- not only did it sound great in my regular voice, but I could even hear myself whispering (yes, I tested that too) --- so don't believe those who say that people on the other end will not hear you --- outbound sound quality wise, its the best headset out there, as I heard no static, no drop-outs, and no tunnel effects2. SIZE --- easily, this is the most comfy headset out there --- it is optional to attach it to your ear, and wear it without the loop --- honestly, the loop holds it in place much better, with no discomfort one bit --- yes, you can wear it without the loop, and it will hold okay, but either way is fine --- the thing is TINY which is neat3. CALL PICK UP --- call pick up happens instaneous, with a half a second delay --- no manual initiation necessary4. BATTERY and CHARGER --- the battery seems to hold just fine all day --- and the charger is real small --- the package also includes a USB charger, so that you can charge it over USB on your computer, which I thought was pretty useful for people on the roadOther pros would be that the RANGE seems pretty solid, and PAIRING was easy (I liked that JABRA created a SEPERATE pairing button)I would consider VOLUME a pro --- it would be nice if it was louder --- however, I can hear everyone just fine, provided that I'm indoors (whether that be in the office, in the car, etc) --- it can hold its own outdoors, but if you use your headset a lot outside, then you may wanna test run the JX10 first --- I think the Cardo Scala 500 had the LOUDEST volume, and the JX10 comes very close to that loudnessCONS ---1. BUTTONS --- this is really a MINOR complaint --- I think the button placement (accepting calls, ending calls) could be a little better - but its not a big deal, and certainly, not a deal breaker --- the thing is so small, that its kinda hard to fit any buttons on it anywayshonestly --- can't think of any other consThe headset is definitely the best looking --- silver with black streaks!I love this headset, and its gonna be awhile until its unseatedyes, the price is steep, but its worth it --- take my word for itthank you for reading and HAPPY BUYING!!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasently Surprised - the Best BT Headset Out There", "unixReviewTime": 1138406400, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2006"},

Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone. I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the \"handset lifter\" is included($39 value)at the Amazon price. My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports. The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base. Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset. You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear, push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active. Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to. What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past. During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install.

The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response.  Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference.  There are some minor issues though.  Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time, but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch. But even then it is not unbearable.  I have cycled with them, music stops when you answer and then resumes.  I have jogged with them, ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary. Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast.  Flipping through songs, and you have to re-pair the device.  Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance.  Very slightly muffled, but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor.  A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing.  Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones.  Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this, but it is quirky.  I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth.  Excellent for cycling!Update 8/22/07  This headset continues to operate great, despite being dropped numerous times. As a side note, I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent.  While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming, this was different.  I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it.  Fixed.  The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way.  Yep, I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot.  Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops.  I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila, the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly.

I've been using these headphones with theJabra Bluetooth Music Adapterand the headphones outlast the adapter every time, and we're talking about 8+ hours of constant use.I'm also using this headset along with my PC and my RazrV3m. The phone does not support Stereo Bluetooth Audio (A2DP) but it does support the regular headset profile that most, if not all Bluetooth enabled phones have. This means that the headphones work as a regular wireless headset for any Bluetooth enabled phone or Skype on your PC / Mac.On the PC, the headphones provide the mic input, the mono headset feature and the stereo headset feature. This means that I can be watching a video or listening to music in beautiful stereo sound and if a call comes though on Skype, it'll switch over to the microphone & mono headset profile for the VOIP conversation. The same is true for using the music adapter mentioned above and a mobile phone. When a call comes in, the music pauses / mutes (depending on the device) and you can answer the call by tapping the left ear piece. Tapping the right ear piece will pause / mute the music at any time.Sound quality is actually very impressive. If you're using these with your PC and the sound is coming through mudddy and crackly, it means that you're not using the Stereo (higher audio quality as well) profile. It's quite possible to listen to music using the Mono (used for mobile phone conversations) profile, but you're missing the great sound if you do.A great thing about the sound quality is that the range is quite wide.

After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens.

HOWEVER, you most change the file extension from \".mp3\" to \".3gp\". Transfering \".3gp\" files to your phone is a sinch with the free USB cable and PC software.  And, if you want to edit your mp3 so that you play only the chorus of the song as the ringtone, Samsung gives you software for that too!!!! It's all included in the PC Studio Software that comes with the phone.  DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE EXTENSION TO \".3GP\" .  The phone will allow you to play any mp3 songs (like an IPOD) but it won't allow you to make MP3 songs as ringtones unless you pay for it by downloading from some website like T-mobile. . . OR, by the method mentioned above.  Changing the extension to 3gp is also easy if you have a program that will show you the FULL NAME of a music file (i.e. check_up_on_it.mp3), like Nero Burning ROM.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "love this phone but watch out for the bluetooth headset", "unixReviewTime": 1144195200, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2006"},

{"reviewerID": "A1ULPGDCSX8XUH", "asin": "B000E93M4I", "reviewerName": "Jeantet Fields", "helpful": [82, 82], "reviewText": "Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you're saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don't do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it's not as loud as an office phone's speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It's a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day \"trial\" period during which you can test the network's performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models \"quad-band\" GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they'll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola's recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don't use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn't get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a \"Phone Tools\" application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone's contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here's the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn't caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn't differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you'll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking \"icky\".In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it's a good phone, it's solid, it's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive", "unixReviewTime": 1159056000, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2006"},

Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say \"name dial\" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very slick, but not the best phone.", "unixReviewTime": 1151020800, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2006"},

The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date.

I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.

Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.Third, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only \"Memory Sticks.\"Fourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.Fifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't \"see\" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better.

It has the same problems.  That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails, whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long, then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now, if I am really careful how I handle it, my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR, which is a close relative of the RAZR, has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time, when I try to make a call, the display will say \"Calling xxxxxxx\" but it just hangs there until I click End, even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it, the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again, I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works, though, it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs, like the other reviews said, but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and, hopefully, it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time, I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable, I would highly recommend the phone.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great phone, when it works", "unixReviewTime": 1142553600, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2006"},

It took a LOT of effort to learn and customize in order to use it effectively, but after that, it's very good.  If and only if you're up for the effort, I highly recommend the phone.  Older phones I've had were much more usable out of the box.MENUS:I changed the home screen buttons around to have the items I use the most - SMS, recent calls, and calendar, and to put phone book where I'm used to it being.  I also changed menu order.  Some moron put Tools under the Settings menu; that can't be fixed.  Since when is a Tool a kind of Setting?  Maybe it makes more sense in whatever language the developers speak.PHONE BOOK.I changed the phone book listing format - this was CRUCIAL to making it usable.  It has its own Setup menu, separate from Settings. These made it usable, especially View and View by:-- View by:list, Sort by:name, View:Primary Contacts, Search Method: Jump To.  I synchronize my phone book with my Mac iBook using the FREE iSync, for easy data entry and for backup.STORAGE:ESSENTIAL: I changed where it stores images, games, and ringtones (from the phone to the memory card), which allowed me to transfer images to my computer, transfer games to & from my computer (e.g. cellufun's free sudoku, chess, etc.), and use an mp3 as a ringtone.  This should be possible from the phone's internal memory, but it isn't, so WOW - knowing that this change makes is possible makes the phone MUCH BETTER than I thought it was at first.  Also, these settings (and some others too) get lost if the phone loses power and have to be reset; this is LAME!BLUETOOTH:It works well with the cardo scala-500 I got from amazon.  I set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. FYI, if you get a bluetooth headset, be warned that it can't be used to listen to music; in fact, if you have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music through the built-in speaker.  [Edit: it does work with some (unspecified) bluetooth headsets, according to the manual; Update: BUT, I've tried 3 bluetooth headset models and they didn't work.  The SLVR doesn't support the required protocol, A2DP, so I think the statement in the manual is false.]iTunes:Very good!  I just wish it would remember what songs it had already played.  [Edit: maybe the repeat all option does that; it's undocumented; trying it now...]PRICE:I got mine for $50 with contract renewal from cingular ~Mar '06; a billing dispute took such a huge effort to resolve that the office of the president staff let me get it at that price.I've yet to figure out how to use the free EDGE I have grandfathered on my account to browse the Internet at no charge.

This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market. Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products. I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls. Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints. Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but nothing past 15 feet.3.

It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 \"Cobalt\").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.

I use a dialup POP account to access the web (from an old Treo 270) and bought this phone because it allows dialup IP connections where the Treo 650 doesn't.  I'd originally purchased a 650 and returned it because it prevents you from accessing the web via dialup (as soon as you put in the SIM card, it defaults to T-Mobile's GPRS network and locks out any other type of internet connection).Unfortunately, the PocketPC interface is absolutely unintuitive as compared to the Palm OS.  Where the Palm may require one or two clicks to access something or intitiate a task, the PocketPC requires you go through very cumbersome menus in order to achieve the same actions.  Learning these menus is a real pain.  Even such simple items as exiting a program or function can be frustrating because the commands needed to do so will change depending on the application you may be running (something as basic as a close box will move location from one program to another).  \"How do I get out of this?\"  one app has a close box in the upper right hand of the screen, another app. requires you to access a menu and then close.  When using the phone, turning on the speakerphone requires going through two menus where in the Palm OS it's thoughtfully placed right on your main phone screen.The slide out keyboard, although it looks cool- is very difficult to use.  Because the keys need to be flat in order to fit under the slide, they are not tactile enough to distinguish easily with your thumb, there is little resistance to activating them and it is very easy to press the wrong key unintentionally.  The stylus is laughably unusable as it's located on the bottom of the unit, is too small as well as being telescoping in a way where it's constantly collapsing as you try to use it.Where the Treo has a physical exterior switch to go into vibrate or quiet mode, the MDA/KJAM requires you to go through at least 2 onscreen menus to turn off the ringer.  I bought a 1 Gig memory card for the unit but can't seem to get it to save pix or video to the card.  I'm sure there's a way to do it, but again it requires learning more unintuitive steps & configurations from the manual.  When talking on the phone it's very easy to touch the screen with your ear or face so that functions and applications accidentally launch.

Had seen reviews that averaged 4.4 out of 5, so it seemed to be a decent choice. This turned out to be one of the best decisions made this year, as the BlackBerry turned out to be far better than expected... it was faster than my previous phone, reliable, versatile and rugged, and there were few dropped calls. But the phone had one simple problem: it's a battery eater!Went to my cell phone provider to see about getting an extra battery, and was surprised to find that the standard 1000 mAh OEM Lithium Ion battery cost was almost $45.00. That seemed a bit steep, so I began searching here on Amazon.com and found this Blackberry Li-Ion [OEM] C-S2 Battery. Was cautious because of the extreme price difference, but figured that if it was truly an OEM C-S2 battery, it was worth the gamble.Examined it when it arrived, and found that it not only had the original BlackBerry logo, but was marked C-S2 on the face, the correct version for my phone (and many other BlackBerry models). The back listed it as a Lithium Ion Battery, 3.7V, with a capacity of 1150mAh 4.3Wh... identical to my original battery. So it was charged overnight, as had done when the phone was first received with the original battery.It was good choice, as the battery has been a perfect backup to my original. It has function just the same as the original C-S2 battery, and there seems to be no difference. Went on to buy a second backup, just because it seemed to be a good idea for those \"better safe than sorry\" situations. Must admit that I do use the built-in GPS quite a bit, and that along with frequent 'Net access, probably accounts for my need of extra battery power. Might note that I picked up anExternal Battery Charger For Blackberry 8300 8320 8330, which has been the perfect compliment to these batteries.One might note that the prices on the BlackBerry C-S2 OEM batteries seem to vary quite a bit here, but most seem to come in well under $7.00... far less that what the cell phone retailers are charging. Do your searching here on Amazon.com and you'll find some excellent prices on these.If your battery seems to not last as long as the original specs for the BlackBerry stated, you can argue with the retailer... or waste far less time and get one of these C-S2 OEM batteries here.

It's a bit funky to get used to, like learning all the colors and flashing LED's, beeps or the controls.  It's also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries.  I recommend you don't read the getting started guide, rather jump right into the user manual.You should get in the package:  1 BT620s headset, 1 USB to USB mini cord, 1 AC adapter, getting started guide, and user manual, spare pair of ear cushions, and finally a carrying bag.I was a little overwhelmed of the things it says it can do, so I thought it had about 10 buttons on each side.  Actually, both sides have 3 identical buttons (the big center button, and up and downs (left: volume, right: jump tracks or FF or RW).  The left big button is for phone control AND turning the power on and off and activating discovery mode.  The right big button just pauses, plays.The user guide explains the the length of holding the button down does different things.  For example: to turn it on, press the left button for a second.  To turn off, hold the same button for 5 seconds.  To turn on discovery mode - hold it for 5 seconds while OFF.  Cool beeping sounds tells you what is about to happen.It sounds great.  All the buttons that are applicable work (all but phone).  Good range.  The manual claims that the purpose for the usb to mini usb is so you can charge and wirey listen to music from your computer.  But it didn't work for me - it only allowed me to charge.  But you should be able to charge your headset where ever there is a powered USB port: PC's, PlayStation 2!  It's too uncomfortable having a thick usb wire hanging and and tied to my PC while listening to music anyway.The AC charger is cool because it's wider instead of longer then normal AC adapters so you can fit another plug below it.  There was absolutely no mention of the carrying bag ANYWHERE.  It still won't protect from the elements or drops or crushing it.  It's cool for reusing it as little things I guess.As for all behind the ear headphones, lying in bed is really uncomfortable, especially if your a side sleeper.And, unlike the logitech, NO signs of cracking on the band.Cons: I never want to see the flashing two blue LED's (steaming stereo).  It is possible to turn them off but they always seem to find a way back on; a little heavy; no user replaceable battery.EDIT: 5/8/11It's been sitting in a box for years, so I charged and paired it up.

It is an annoyance to have to do this every time you turn them on.Sound quality is adequate and no more. I'm hardly an audiophile and don't demand much in the way of fidelity, which is a good thing with the BT620s, since its audio response is defeinitely \"lo-fi\", not HiFi.I am constantly bothered by what sounds like static with my BT620s. When I make a call or dictate a note, my voice is recognizeable, but it does sound like I am talking through a pipe or something. Overall, sound quality with these is barely passable.The wraparound headband is not adjustable. Your tolerance for pain and discomfort on the other hand better be. There is a bit of an art to positioning these on your head. A millimeter this way or that means the difference beween mere discomfort and outright pain. After a while, you'll learn where your own sweet spot is with these, but I doubt you or I will ever find these things to be comfortable.Is the Jabra BT620 awful?

Oh", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not ready for Prime Time", "unixReviewTime": 1194134400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2007"},

It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the \"my computer\" icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved \"Disc2phone\" and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes \"Stereo Widening\" impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My First Sony Ericsson, A review from a Nokia Fanboy", "unixReviewTime": 1152316800, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2006"},

I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo's, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about  up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and \"Kill All\" tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update: 6/12/06After a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn't even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.

This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is \"spoofing\" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to \"white list\" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" fields configurable.

The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...", "helpful": [406, 410], "reviewText": "The LG VX8300 is the latest offering in the market for do-(almost)-it-all cell phones.  It combines all of the standard phone functionality with music and video playback and phone, making it a media powerhouse considering that it's such a portable, affordable package.  The next step up would be a smartphone, but at significant extra cost for the addition of more well-rounded PDA functions.THE PHONEThe first thing you'll notice about the 8300 is that it's a great-looking piece of tech - stylish and modern yet also subdued enough that it won't embarrass you in business settings.  Some pictures make it look black, but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color.  It's roughly the same size (3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9) as LG's other recent clamshell phones, although a little slimmer for easier pocketing.  It feels solid but not heavy at 3.9 oz with the standard battery.  The plastic case feels softer than prior models, so it may be more susceptible to scratches and scrapes over time.  There is a leather case for it, but I doubt you could bear the idea of covering up this good-looking unit.The 8300 runs on Verizon's CDMA all-digital network, so coverage may be an issue if you live in rural areas.  I've been a Verizon customer for years with LG digitals and never run into any dead spots around town and while traveling, but check Verizon's coverage maps on their website beforehand.Voice clarity is superb, both for you and for the person you're calling.  The 8300 has speakerphone capability, but amplified through the external audio speakers, it tends to be so loud that it may distort - set your volume appropriately low.The phone has a wide array of conveniences, including numerous handy voice-activated commands (send messages, check voice mail, look up contact, examine wireless account, etc.), one-touch calling, unique rings and photo IDs for different contacts, an address book with room for 500 contacts, and so on.  I'm a huge proponent of the voice-activated commands, and while the 8300 is very easy to set up, the long-term downside is that instead of matching up your command with your own prerecorded voice as prior models did, this phone tries to actually phonetically \"read\" entries from your contacts list and find a match that way.  So, if you have unusually-spelled names with silent letters in your contacts list, the 8300 will have a tough time making a match.  Plus, when it repeats the name back to you, it generally mangles the pronunciation, making that form of caller ID undesirable.  It's too bad that the contacts list doesn't have a separate \"nickname\" field so that you could accurately store the contact as say, \"Mike Krzyzewski\" but have the voice-activated commands look the entry up as \"Coach\", for example.If you're obsessive about ringtones, then you'll be disappointed with the default offerings.  They play back with great quality, but they're pretty boring.  Verizon clearly wants you to go to their GetItNow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones.  It's not documented in the manual, but it is possible to use MP3s loaded into the phone as ringtones.The phone supports Bluetooth v.1.1, which makes it easily compatible with many wireless devices like headsets/earpieces.  You can also use this to wirelessly transmit and receive contact information with other Bluetooth devices.THE CAMERAI bought my first digital camera about five years ago - a 1.3 megapixel Olympus for about $350.  Now, for a fraction of the price and space, the 8300 delivers that same picture quality.  It's also got additional features that make the results actually worth viewing/printing, including flash, white balancing for a variety of lighting conditions (no more washed out or oddly-tinted phone pics), a four-position digital zoom, and night mode.  There are also some capabilities for having fun with your photos such as special effects (negative, posterize, etc.), self-portrait capability using the external screen as a viewfinder, and a timer.  You can take pictures from 160x120 thumbnails all the way up to print-quality 1280x960.The camera can also take videos, although the quality is predictably choppy and the largest clip that can be sent via email is only 15 seconds.  Like any of the phone's media, larger clips can be stored to the phone's internal memory or onto an optional microSD card and then copied to another device or PC.Photos taken can be used as contact IDs or wallpaper on either the external or main screen.  Both screens are breathtaking in their brightness, clarity and resolution.  They never fail to register the initial jaw-dropping compliment when someone sees the phone for the first time.MUSIC PLAYERYou can't really say MP3 player because the 8300 wants to only play files in Microsoft's .wma format.  This is because Verizon wants you to use their VCast online music store.  I purchased the Music Essential Pack with my phone and was sorely disappointed in this - the VCast software wouldn't load (it kept trying to roll me back to Windows Media Player 10 even though I'm on 11), the USB cable kept losing connection (crummy driver software), and the headphones were just so-so.  I recommend instead investing in a big MicroSD card and using it to store and transfer all of your music, photos and videos.  This is clearly the easiest way to load information back and forth between the phone, although Verizon won't tell you that since it cuts their overpriced music store out of the loop.  And if you do prefer MP3s for playback, the 8300 may not be configured out of the box to play them, but it's a simple change to make - just search the web for instructions.The sound for playback is very good, again considering that it's not a dedicated music device.  The external stereo speakers are on either side of the clamshell hinge and they pump out a lot of sound for their size.  The 8300 has a very good ergonomic feature in the form of player control buttons (play/pause, fast forward, rewind) on the outside face of the phone.  So, you can keep it in the palm of your hand rather than flipped open while listening.BUSINESS/PRODUCTIVITYThe 8300 comes with the standard roster of business apps dumbed down for cell phone usage:  calendar, world clock, calculator with tip macros, etc.  At this time, I haven't found an easy way to sync data back and forth with any desktop apps like Outlook or Notes.  There are open source apps on the Web like Bitpim that can do this, but the 8300 is currently too new for that software to handle.  That gap should be remedied soon.Verizon offers wireless broadband via an EV-DO network that includes most major metropolitan areas and airports.One exceptional add-on that Verizon offers is VZ Navigator, which turns the 8300 into a GPS-driven navigation device.  You can purchase the add-on either monthly if you do a lot of traveling by car or even day-to-day if you're just taking a short trip.  It works well, looks great, and really boosts the usefulness of this unit.CONCLUSIONThe LG VX8300 combines a great phone, a camera that's actually useful and some pretty cool media capabilities into one compact unit.  There are of course some trade-offs for each, but the convenience of only having to carry one slim item in your pocket is invaluable.  It really is a marvel for the price.PROS* A very clear phone with many convenient features like voice-activated commands.* A 1.3 megapixel camera capable of taking pictures you'd actually have printed thanks to 1280x960 resolution, flash, and color effects.* A good-sounding music player that, when combined with your own library on an optional microSD card, puts hours of entertainment in your pocket.* Bluetooth capability for wireless add-ons and communication with other devices.CONS* Incompatible with existing accessories - get ready to buy new chargers, sync cables, etc.* VCast music store is overpriced and not easy to set up (just get a microSD card and use it to store/transfer media instead - no problem).* Initial selection of ringtones is pretty dull - another attempt by Verizon to squeeze extra charges out of you.* Some of the external buttons are awkwardly sized and/or placed - people with larger hands may cramp up after prolonged periods of use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sleek Looking Phone with Lots of Nice Functionality", "unixReviewTime": 1150156800, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2006"},

Only today, it's hooked up to my Bluetooth in the car, and it stays in its little cubbyhole and doesn't see the light of day except for its weekly charge.

After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls, this is what we chose. I don't need the camera, but now you have no choice. With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones. Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.Four stars because it's a fairly good phone, and I've given up on persuading anyone under 50 that they still need a wired phone especially when you want to talk to more than one person at a time.

Like most of you, when this came out I really, really wanted one, but they were just too pricey. Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy.  I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The \"flat\" buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit.  I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me.  The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem.  If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option.  I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two.  The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect?  Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said:  If you want a decent camera get a decent camera.

I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need.  If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds.  The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that.  For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles.  This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be \"taught\" and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone.  You sometimes hear \"the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless.\"  That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option.  The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring.  I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail.  As is, you have to open the Razr to check this.  An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts (\"Do you really want to delete this missed call?\").  There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it.

The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else.

This headset is currently paired with a Blackberry 8800.Pros -1) Audio - ...is stellar. Yes, its prone to interference, but I've yet to see a unit that doesn't occasionally give you a bit of static (JX10 - I'm looking at you!). Callers were impressed to hear that I was using a headset.2) Pairing - I've always thought this process to be a bit obtuse, but I guess it drives down costs to have the much-vaunted \"multi-funtion\" button. I find it annoying. That said, pairing was quick and easy with this unit and it **stays** paired for hours at a time.3) Fit - Stays paired and stays in my ear for hours at a time. Does it hurt? Heck, even my ears can't stand canalphones. I stand at 6 feet and yet I have the earcanals of a 5 year old, I guess. I don't have a problem using this set all day, but my ears are still a bit sore. Still, this is much better than other models I've used (JX10 - I'm still looking at you!). For the record, I'm using the smallest gel. The WEP200 gives you three different sizes.4) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around. I've tried expensive, I've tried cheap, I've tried middle of the road. So far, the WEP200 beats em all, even when not factoring in the cost.5) Range - doesn't matter what side of my body this unit is on, it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800. I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro. It gives you just enough freedom to roam. You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.Cons -1) Size - Unit is super tiny! It gets lost in my shirt pocket, my jacket pocket, left on the counter. Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile. Its never a fun scramble, especially when someone important is at the other end. \"Hang on a second! I need to find the headset!!!\"2) Charger - Not thrilled about the charger/carrying case, but if it helps keep the size of the headset down, I can't complain too much. I feel compelled to get my wife to buy one, just so we'd have two chargers around the house - one for upstairs and another downstairs.

I've been able to freely talk and move my head around without feeling like the headset would fall out.Battery life:The battery life seems to be shorter than my Plantronics Voyager 510, but it's understandable with the much smaller size of the WEP200.  I really haven't had an issue with the battery, as long as I remember to take it out of the car with me to charge overnight or during the day.  I have to take it with me because, as of March 2008, there doesn't seem to be a car charger accessory for this headset.Update May 2008:  As M. Cirone points out in the comment below, there are now car charger accessories available for the WEP 200!Sound quality:The sound quality isn't as good as my Plantronics Voyager either, but it's still good enough for phone calls.  People on the other end don't seem to have problems understanding me and I can hear them well enough.Ease of use:The buttons are big and easy to reach, but take a little bit of force.

Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model, but it is not any different in design.  However, it's so cheap with rebate, it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore, after this appealing review, and you still want to buy this thing, I would go for the newer one.  But, don't say I (we!) didn't warn you!NOTE: If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached, please disregard this review.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Great!

It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked.

Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit \"ok.\" This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little \"far-away.\" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price.

Here are some of the pros and cons so you can get some basis for comparison when purchasing one BT headset:PROS1. Price. I got this device for $33. I don't think you can get a comparable BT headset for a lower price.2. Sound Quality. This device has good volume level and low static.  I have streched it all the way to the range limit (30 ft.) and the call quality is still good with no static.  I have left my phone or computer in the living room/middle level of my townhome and have gone up and down the stairs to other rooms without loosing the call.3. Compatibility.  I haven't had any issues pairing this device up with the following devices: Motorola PEBL, Nokia E62 and HP Pavillion laptop. I have used remote commands such as voice commands, redial or answer with the two phones with no issues, and have used it with Skype and MSN Messenger without any problem.  One user commented that the personalized/group ring tones did not transmit to the BT headset, but this is a limitation of the phone, because the MotoPEBL does not transmit a specific ring tone assigned to a person, and rather a default one, but the Nokia E62 sends the proper ring tone to the headset so you know who is calling without having to look at the phone (good when driving!)4. Battery life.  I have not tried really long calls so I can not comment on exact talk time, but overall I have used it continously in stand-by plus regular calls (for me 10-15 minutes, 4-5 calls a day) without recharging for 3-4 days.CONS:1. Bad Design.  As noted by other users, the device wiggles in your ear and you feel it is going to fall when you walk, move your head (sudden movements) or even driving (believe it or not, the inertia when making turns on you car makes this BT headset to move away from your ear, almost falling).  A strong wind will knock it out from your ear.  It fits ok, though, and does not hurt your ear (not heavy at all).  Perhaps that is the main reason why it wiggles so much, maybe it is too light.2. Powering on/off.  Since it only has one main button (two small ones for volume +/- and mute) that you use for power, pairing, answering or dial commands, then you can, for example, get into pairing mode when simply turning it on, or if attached to a phone, you may redial a call rather than turning it off.  Once you learn how to use it and pay attention to the blue led signals, it is ok, but I think it requires one extra button for power on/off.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase. If it weren't for the two CONs, I would have rated it with 5 starts.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Price. Good sound. Bad design.", "unixReviewTime": 1173225600, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2007"},

So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews.  I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it.  I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.Getting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.Using the headset is no brainer basically.  There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons.  Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic.  Its very small and very comfortable to wear.  The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well.  The buttons feel solid as well.Now to the actual sound quality.  The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment.  I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways.  Again very impressive.  The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store.  I will update once I've tested that as well.I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.  I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic headset at a great price.", "unixReviewTime": 1173225600, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2007"},

{"reviewerID": "ASHMKDJI9Q3K4", "asin": "B000GX9D9K", "reviewerName": "K. Gehrke", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor fit, average function", "unixReviewTime": 1215907200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2008"},

I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism, and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone), and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting \"unpaired\" from my Treo 680.

It works, but it could be much much better.First, I think technology still has a long way to go with regards to bluetooth/wireless headsets.  Sound quality on this thing, while loud enough, made everyone sound like they were talking through several layers of tshirts. Everyone I've spoken to on this says they can tell I'm \"on something\" but that I sound \"fine.\"  Fine isn't good enough for me.Let's talk design: It absolutely excels in the \"Cool\" department - it looks slick and isn't some chubby ear thing.  But, with that cool looking factor comes a lose and ill-fitting earpiece.  Yes, it comes with 3 replacable earpieces, but none fit me quite right. I would like to offer this suggestion to all who own/consider owning this: When you are trying to insert this into your ear, take your hand opposite the side of the ear you are putting this in, grab the top of your earlobe and pull up while twisting this thing into your ear canal. I got it to fit OK but walking around with it - it feels like it's going to fall out any second.The buttons: Yes they are small but we are all aware that as technology shrinks, so are the buttons. Yes, they are difficult to use, but I'm used to it and you should be too.  Main problem: Is that you really have to press down for the buttons to click, and this thing is already ready to fall out of your ear, so trying to slam on a button isn't helping.  Why someone doesn't put a nice little trackwheel for volume on one of these things is beyond me.You can walk around with this but you'll want to keep your phone nearby - I walked into the next room not more than 10 feet from the phone and it got static, etc.  Pretty weak if you ask me.It works OK. It paired up with my Motorolla KRZR just fine and works no problem.

I have owned several Bluetooth headsets in the past, most made by Motorola, and I have always continued looking for something that would stay in place and sound good to both myself and the people that I call.  I just can't seem to find a Bluetooth wireless headset that shines in all of the important areas.  They either fit lousy or sound lousy or both!  This new headset from Plantronics looked to be the answer to my search for near perfection.  It is very lightweight, fits snug in my ear, and has a very impressive appearence.  It even comes with a multitude of charging accessories, to allow you to charge from a standard 110 volt household outlet, charge from a USB port on a home or office computer, and even charge from a single AAA alkaline battery.  The headset provides very good tonal sound quality to the user and the sound output is quite good for the person on the other end of the conversation.  What more could a person want from a wireless headset?  How about decent phone to headset reception?  Even with my Motorola Razr V3 and Razr MaxxVE cellular phones clipped to the belt around my waist I still experience constant reception problems.  There is noticeable crackling and popping sounds and sometimes brief cutout of the conversation.  Although the people on the other end of my conversations say that they notice only slight flaws in the sound, I find the amount of noise in the reception to be distracting and very annoying.  The proximity of my phone to the headset doesn't seem to be the problem at all.  Most of the time the headset is less than 3 feet from the cell phone it is paired with.  I have tried the headset with both my work phone and personal phone, as well as with my wife's phone.  Changing phones has no effect on the reception problems.  To add further frustration, the headset does not work properly with the voice-dial feature of my phones.  All of my previous Bluetooth headsets would allow you to push the call button, which would prompt the cell phone to activate the voice-dialing feature.  This Plantronics model requires you to manually activate the voice-dial feature from the telephone itself or to punch in the phone number yourself.  This really prevents me from using the headset as a safer means of calling from my car while traveling.  I constantly receive compliments from friend and coworkers regarding how sleek the headset looks.  But that just doesn't offset all of the shortcomings this headset has in terms of reception and functionality.  The Plantronics Discovery 655 has a great look and an abundance of \"extras\" that are included in the package.  However, if you are looking for reliable Bluetooth headset that will offer great sound and above average reception then I would recommend that you look elsewhere.  I still give this item an overall rating of 3 stars because of its design, lightweight, comfortable fit and variety of charging options.

I had read a lot of reviews on multiple sites that indicated that a lot of bluetooth headsets didn't provide a clear signal.  Based on the cnet review I assumed the 655 was different.This being my first bluetooth headset, I'm not exactly sure what the standard is.  However, the Plantronics literature for this model clearly states that users will have \"33 feet to roam.\"  In my experience, using a Blackberry 8700g, this is just false.  I get a clear signal 8 to 10 feet away from my phone.  After that the static kicks in and and increases dramatically as the distance increases.  Maybe Plantronics is just copying the hyperbole of other manufactuers.  Nonetheless,I'm not sure if I would have purchased this model if I had known that I was limited to 10 feet at most.With that said, I do find that reception is very clear within the 8 foot range.  Also, the volume control is excellent.

She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices, particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours, but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears, it's probably a bad choice.Here's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings:STYLE & DESIGNI greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510, I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510.I prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However, it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me.COMFORTThe 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510, but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit.PERFORMANCEThis is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330, but none better than the 510. With the 330, I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions, no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world, more like 10' with no obstructions.Noise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise.Both headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening.

While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical, if there's noise, the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought, and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note, the battery, under constant daily use, should last you approximately 500 charges, or 1.5 years avg.

Cool, I thought.  Then I used it less and less, because the thing had to be recharged at home and would only last about an hour.  Soon I thought it was just too hard to use ... hard to put on, and totally weird in that to turn it on you had to take it OFF your ear, flip down the mouthpiece, then put it BACK on your ear.  Whoever designed the thing had no clue how people use headsets.  It also sounded like I was talking from the bottom of a water well.  Whenever I used it on conference calls people would yell for me to go on mute.  So I started asking people in the waiting rooms at airports what brand they had and what brand they liked.  I got so many people who hated Jabra that I didn't even consider it.  I already didn't really care for Motorola, so I started looking at Nokia, which seem to be nice but clumsy, and then I kept meeting more and more people who were in love with their Plantronics.  I have used Plantronics headsets for a long time in the office, after all, that's all they do and they seem to do it well.  I looked at a few Plantronics and didn't find one that jumped out at me, then one day I ran across the Explorer 350.  This was just too good to be true!  Are you kidding me, $49 bucks for a Bluetooth headset made by the top brand?  Then I looked closer and found that Plantronics did something very unique with this headset.  Instead of having to charge it at home, it comes with an extremely cool little clip that either mounts to your dash or hooks to your air vent in your car then plugs into your cigarette lighter.  Now that made sense!  A place to hold the headset where you use it most, always charging, then ready to use in a second or to walk around the rest of the day with it fully charged.  For us road warriors, Plantronics also thoughtfully included a USB charging cable so the trusty laptop will keep your headset charged while you sleep.  You can buy an optional AC adapter if that makes you feel more secure.  So how is it built and how does it perform?  Built like a Hummer!  The main piece is one solid chunk that looks like it is pretty immune to any normal damage while clunking around in your pocket with a lot of coins.  The piece that goes around your ear looks like it is solid as well, and effortlessly switches from ear to ear and slips on with one easy motion.  After the first time, this thing slips on with no thought on my part and instantly is in the perfect position for use.  Operation couldn't be simpler.  Unlike my Motorola with several switches that you had to remember how and what sequence to push them in, the Plantronics has one switch.  Push it in to turn it on, push it in to turn it off, push it in to talk, push it in to hang up, push it in to voice dial, etc.  All you have to do is push.  Want to make it louder or quieter?  Push up or push down.  No-brainer.  I saved performance for last because this is what convinced me to keep it.  After a quick charge I called a friend from my car with the window rolled down.  This is a friend I talk to all the time from my land line.  I said, hey, I just bought a new Bluetooth headset and want to see how it sounds to you.  He said, cool, put it on and I'll let you know.  I said ... I already have it on!  He said the sound was perfect, no background noise of any kind and it sounded at least as good as my landline.  One of the things several of my airport buddies told me they liked about Plantronics is how the durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside your ear and blocks out noise ... like annoying flight announcements.  I have to say that not only did I sound perfect to my friend but every call I have been on has been easier to hear than with any other headset I have ever tried.PROS:Sound QualitySuperior constructionEase of usePairing - instant and flawlessPriceComfortCONS:None I could see.

{"reviewerID": "A1W5N8OT55A9Y3", "asin": "B000HBPMVY", "reviewerName": "B. Christensen \"Frequent traveler, business o...", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I purchased this unit primarily to use with my MacBook and Skype for conducting business calls.  Previously I was using the Logitech Clear Chat Pro wired USB headset with very good results, but after breaking a couple of them by accidentally yanking the cords from my Mac, I wanted to try a wireless solution.  So far, the results have been mixed.  Here are some highlights:1. Build Quality - 3 starsThe build quality seems pretty good, especially for something in this price range.  The construction is mostly all plastic, but the hinge mechanisms and stress points appear to be adequately constructed.  I would NOT expect these headsets to stand up to much abuse - e.g. extensive travel where they are jammed in and out of a bag, dropped on the ground, etc.  For daily office or home use where they are place into a drawer or on a desk when not in use, they should give a good service life.  People have complained that the foam earpieces fall off, but after a couple weeks of use, I have not seen any indications of this problem.  The switches all operate smoothly, and while the overall design is a bit clunky, that is more an aesthetic comment than a quality comment.2. Features - 4 starsThe headset has a good feature set, supporting both the stereo headphone profile (A2DP) and the \"headset\" profile.  I have used these with both my Mac and my iPhone and with the Mac both profiles work, with easy switching between the two using the \"Bluetooth Preferences\" drop down for on-the-fly changes.  With the iPhone, only the \"headset\" profile is supported (this is an iPhone limitation, NOT a limitation of this headset).  Buttons for volume, skip/fast forward, skip/fast rewind work well with iTunes on the laptop.  Only the volume controls and \"call answer/end\" buttons seem to work with the iPhone in the headset mode.3. Operation/usage  - 2 starsPairing with both the Mac and the iPhone was absolutely seamless, and switching between the two is fairly straightforward, though I have not tried to have the headset paired and connected to both devices - I'm not sure this works.  For now, I disable Bluetooth on my iPhone when it is nearby and I want to pair the PT590 to my Macbook, because otherwise the PT590 will connect to its last device, which is usually my iPhone when on the road.  The comfort of these headphones is so-so - the ear pads are relatively small, and the over-the-head band is quite tight (and I have a small head).  I can imagine that they would be quite uncomfortable for anyone with a large melon.  Stretching the band would be dangerous, since it is made of plastic and would probably break.  perhaps heating it with a blow dryer and gently stretching it out might work...  The foam ear pads are thin, and since the ear pieces press pretty firmly against the head, they do cause minor discomfort after some period of time.  They are no where near as comfortable as my Bose QCII headphones, but these are $60 and the Bose are $300, so I would expect that to be the case.  They are more comfortable than other headphones I have had in this &lt;$100 price range, including both wired and wireless units.  I would not recommend them for all-day use sitting at a desk (get the Bose and live with the wires), but for short stints they are great.The blue light is annoying, but it is also an important status indicator for things like call status and battery life.  It is one of the ways my wife knows when I am on a call in my office when she walks in to talk to me.Operating the unit is very easy - answering a call, you touch a button, the same button ends the call. For listening to music, the controls are a bit less intuitive - the top and bottom buttons skip forward or reverse, and the front and rear buttons increase or decrease the volume - this seems like it was not thought out very well, as the functions between the two pairs of buttons should be swapped to be more intuitive.The pull-out boom for the mic is a nice feature, and there is a built-in wind screen.  I have not tried these units in windy conditions but would expect their performance to exceed many other \"mini\" headsets for mobile phone usage.One \"nit\" I have is that in order to get the boom mic to point down towards one's mouth, the headband needs to sit pretty far forward on the head - it feels slightly unnatural.  So this leaves you with the choice of either tilting the whole setup forward to angle the mic towards the mouth, or put them on feeling more natural, but have the mic pointed up at one's nose/cheek.Note:  I use these headphones alongside a logitech bluetooth mouse and have been surprised at how little interference there is between the two.  Occasionally my mouse will freeze, but a click will usually quickly restore service to the mouse.  There is no static induced in the headphones by the mouse that I can discern.4. Performance - 4 stars for music,  2 stars for SkypeOverall performance of these units is quite good, with the exception of VOIP or Skype calling.4.1 Music - music sounds surprisingly full and rich, given that these units are small and rather flimsy feeling (e.g. lightweight).  The are \"on the ear\" style headphones, so they do not offer any passive noise reduction, and the sound leakage from the outside into the ears as well as from the 'phones to the outside is pretty significant (I can't watch a movie on my laptop in bed while my wife is trying to sleep - something I do routinely with my Bose QCII headphones).  But for average music listening, they are really surprisingly good.  By tweaking the EQ settings, you can get them to sound as good or better than many wired headphones in this price range, and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low.4.2 Skype - 1 star - I cannot recommend these units for Skype - Out use.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth for VOIP calling, as I have not tried other Bluetooth sets, the amount of lag introduced by these units is unacceptable for business-level conversation.  I know that this is not a limitation of Skype, as I previously used a wired Logitech headset with very good results with Skype.  The lag can vary in severity, but even at its best, it is noticeable - almost like talking to someone over a satellite connection where there is several hundred milliseconds of delay.  It can get annoying very quickly.  At its worst, it is totally unusable, as people I am talking to hear nothing but static and garbled speech.  I have reached the point where I really only use them when I am on long conference calls where I just have to listen for 95% of the time.  For real calls, I have had to go back to using my cell phone.4.3 Phone - 5 stars - probably the best quality audio (both mic and speakers) that I have used with my iPhone or my Motorola Razr.  The headphones are big and dorky looking while walking through an airport, but boy, they sure stay on your head when you lean over to pick up your bag, and they seem to do a great job of filtering out background noise.Overall, the performance of these units is very good for the price.  If you are buying them for music and /or for use with a phone (especially one that supports the A2DP profile)  I highly recommend them - you cannot beat the performance at this price point.  For use with Skype at a desktop computer, I cannot recommend them, and suggest you use a wired USB or audio jack type headset.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great for music, not so great for Skype", "unixReviewTime": 1233273600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2009"},

But if you're driving with both ears covered, you've got more problems than blinking blue lights.2) The sound quality is better than 90% of the Bluetooth headsets I've tried. Way better than Jabra or Motorola. From a call perspective, it's about the same, but as a stereo headset, it's so much better. I can listen to opera and hear the high and low vocals without distortion, which was impossible on the last Jabra I had.3) It requires a pairing code!!! This is important to note. You can't pair it with a device that doesn't allow you to enter a code! So, it won't work with an off-the-shelf 3.5 or 2.5mm adapter. It pairs fine with my computer with built-in Bluetooth, and one of my cell phones because I can enter the code. It does not work with the Bluetooth dongle I bought for my MP3 player because no way to enter a pairing code. Also doesn't work with the USB Bluetooth radio I bought for my other PC. This I found annoying and was the chief reason I dropped a star from the rating. One way around this is to buy the 590A model, rather than the 590E model (the model I'm reviewing) because it comes with a paired adapter. However, the cost is much higher.4) Yes, as others have noted, this headset is made of hard plastic. The more flexible material many of us are used to in headphones is completely absent here. So, if you sit on them, as one user mentioned, you will break them. So don't sit on them. They're not tiny, so they're hardly unobtrusive.5) They are the rare over-the-head headphones. Most Bluetooth these days are behind the neck. I like behind the neck styles, but with very long hair, they're not the best option in the world. These stay on and are comfortable through several hours of wear, and haven't pulled out a single hair yet. My Jabra headphones ripped hair out constantly.6) The controls are mostly nice. I like that they're all on one ear. Some other sets have the controls spread out over the two ear phones, which I find annoying. The one thing I don't like in the controls is that I naturally think of volume as UP DOWN and tracks as BACK FORWARD. The controls are the complete opposite, which is odd to me. The UP button is track forward, the DOWN button is track back. The FORWARD button is volume up and the BACK button is volume down. I don't know who thought of that of that bit of engineering, but it shouldn't have made it out of the drawing room.Overall, I'm very happy with these headphones, there are some minor annoyances, but that can be said for every Bluetooth headphone on the market. The most important thing to me was that the sound quality be good for music play. I have many headsets for phone calls, but this was the first one that had nice music quality. I just wish it worked with a standard Bluetooth adapter.

The Bluetooth adapter that comes with 590A fits very snugly into the iPod 3.5 mm audio jack (unlike many others). Telescopic microphone is unobtrusive, works well on cell phones and the listeners at other end don't complain of poor voice quality.The main drawback of these headsets is their flimsy construction, cheap plastic. One of the cables became loose after a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked. So the sound from one side is intermittent now. Other cons include tiny and poorly placed controls - almost unusable while wearing headsets, very bright blue light and they do not cover the ears completely so there is no blockage of background sound.They are not the perfect Bluetooth headphones but in my experience they have worked better than the other ones that I have tried - iLUV 903 and Logitech", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Performance, Easy Pairing, Flimsy Construction", "unixReviewTime": 1219104000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2008"},

They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired.  And the volume was not loud enough.  I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one.  The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.

These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me, and then some!These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight, but they also won't have you feeling overly weighed down, either. They're simply solid-feeling in weight and construction. I read many other reviews of these online, one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half, and who paid over $120.00 for his pair. Considering the price that I got these for (comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon), I feel like I got mine at a steal, at less than $40.00!These Motorola headphones FEEL like they're worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I didn't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these ISN'T going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.As far as taking calls on these go, there is no obvious microphone on these, but they work great, just the same. My callers had no problems whatsoever hearing me on these, and I could hear them beautifully on them as well. I was told that the audio being received from these was loud, crisp, and clear, and the same seemed to be the case for me as well on the other end of the calls. I've also had no trouble using the operational buttons, and my phone found and paired with these headphones easily. The only thing that I didn't remember when I ordered these, though (completely my own fault), is that I won't be able to wear these to take calls while I'm driving, as traffic laws dictate that both ears cannot be covered and obstruct vital traffic sounds.

Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let's start with the positives:-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage).-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).On the downside:-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Affordable, compact phone", "unixReviewTime": 1172793600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2007"},

Lawrence", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I purchased an LG Env3 and I wanted to stay within the LG products category since they made me such an awesome cell phone and TV.  So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first.  And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized.  I love this headset.  Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music.  And no, the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular, but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music.  I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls.  So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros:+Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as you'd like and then some. I couldn't hear one of my friend's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number (press once), say a voice command (hold button), or hang up the call (press once again) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car! (Details below)+Lightweight. Could be used for running with the right headphones. I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire. The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk. Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons (of course)-Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it isn't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length.  Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone.  Cannot mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual.  I love this headset more than any bluetooth I've ever bought.  And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car.  Well, I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players.  I was on the road and I didn't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset, inserted the tape, turned up the volume, and made a call.  It worked perfectly!  I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers.  The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone.  But the best part was that the headset wasn't clipped to me, it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different.  My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well.  I'll try to remember to update when I know for sure.  Trust me, if you're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt.

So I got this one for my Galaxy Note 2.Note: this case is not meant to protect your device from falls, etc. -- it's no Otterbox or rubber bumper case.  In my case, I didn't want a thick protective case because all of them add significant bulk to the phone.  I carry my phone wherever I go and use it in the case on a windshield mount.  With thick cases, I need a bigger windshield mount (or I need to remove the phone from the case -- a big inconvenience) -- with this slim case, the phone fits on the windshield mount while in the case.Removing the Note 2 from this case takes a little effort but you get better at it with practice.The kickstand is very useful for watching videos and/or reading at the table while having coffee or eating, etc.  It's also useful when ussing an external (bluetooth) keyboard.One downside, the case makes it such that the buttons (power and volume up/down) take some effort to &#34;find&#34; without looking.  I need to be able to quickly whip out my phone at a moment's notice without looking at it.  The case as it is, makes it so that finding those buttons requires a little more effort than without the case and/or actually looking at the sides of the phone.  This flaw is NOT entirely the fault of the case -- I never had this problem with the S3 version of this case.  The reason is that the buttons on the Note 2 are slightly more forward so they blend in a lot more with the edge of the case.My solution: I used a small wire cutter to clip off the edged of the case where it connects the openings for where the buttons are.  This did not affect (at least in any discernible way) the structural integrity of the case as the case is pretty stiff.  Also, I clipped of the edges to they were nice and smooth and looked like that's how the case was made.  Now, I can easily &#34;find&#34; the buttons and use the phone as quickly and effectively as without the case.I would absolutely buy this again and on my next phone, I look forward to getting another.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Slim, textured, with kickstand, looks good, but needed small modification", "unixReviewTime": 1388016000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2013"},

This makes the phone feel a lot wider in your hand than other slim cases.3) is no protection for the bottom of the phone whatsoever. Most slim cases at least have a little wrap around for the bottom edges, this case doesn't even try.The good thing is that it looks like they did put more effort into the belt clip.For the price, I will say it is okay.

When you spend under $5 for a case designed to fit the latest and greatest smartphone on the planet, you're getting a workaround. That was my intention when I purchased the BoxWave.I had been tempted to buy a folio case. Later, I asked myself why -- why do I need to cover the screen? It's made of Gorilla Glass 3. It's the toughest screen out there and nearly impossible to scratch. Someone said their phone, while in this case, shattered from a two-foot drop. I've seen the GS4 survive multiple drop tests from the top of a ladder onto concrete -- with no case for protection. It's built to take abuse. That's why this case makes sense. In my personal opinion, you need a case like this so you can lay the phone on any flat surface. It raises the screen and the camera lens off your desktop. It also improves the phone's grip in your hand. That's what it's for. And perhaps best of all, it barely adds to the phone's already wide and tall dimensions. If you've got a phone this big, do you really want it any bigger?The buttons are not hard to push, but naturally, because they are covered by the case, they are a little hard-ER to press. Still, if you find it &#34;hard&#34; to push the buttons, maybe what you really need is a little iron in your diet.The TPU material is essentially a hard rubber. Too hard and shiny to keep the phone from sliding on your car's dash, so if you're looking for soft rubber, keep looking. The material itself is naturally on the less-than-premium side, meaning it will build up scratches from constant use. Better that this gets scratched than the GS4's own cheap plastic outer surface. The shiny &#34;X&#34; on the back will pick up finger prints. Not a biggie unless you have a pet peeve about such things.As for fit, the case snaps over the GS4 like a glove - quite perfectly, actually. There is no binding, nor is it at all loose anywhere. I would point out, however, that not all the holes are perfectly aligned. I'm only being picky here. The camera cutout and speaker cutout are the tiniest bit off, not enough to make a difference, other than I notice it. The headphone and micro USB ports are wide open, so there are no problems plugging cords in.Get it as your primary case, or get it as a spare to give your phone a new look every once in a while.

The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing! I could understand if the &#8220;Size&#8221; option was for different models of phones, but to have be different CASES is just misleading, and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case&#8230; I bought this because it was one of the &#8220;Best Cases&#8221; for the s4 as per Cnet. I don&#8217;t know what the deal is, however this case is pure garbage! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered! As a result, I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line. The cutout for the camera is the same way. For normal pictures, it is OK as it case does not block the lens, however it does partially cover the flash. As a result, you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless. There is nothing to lock it in place, so the phone falls over unless you balance it &#8220;just right.&#8221; Even then, once you tap the screen (ie: skip a You Tube add), the phone falls over. Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $4 for this case, and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $4 case. I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case. Other cases on this listing &#8220;might&#8221; be a better quality case, however, I would not hold my breath.

I bought this case just to tide me over until I could find a better higher quality one. I already have an Otterbox Commuter, but I like to have several cases. One that provides the most protection for when I'm at work, and others that are smaller and don't add so much bulk. Plus, I am somewhat of a case-whore. I had 12 cases for my S3.I thought this case would be a suitable temporary case until I could find another one. I was wrong. This is just a good case period!Like I said, I prefer slim fitting cases so as not to detract from the over-all slimness of this device. I also prefer the soft gel feel of these types of cases to the hard plastic of others. I find it provides better shock absorbancy and just feels better overall.This is the highest quality case I have ever bought for $1.75 ($4.25 shipped).Service-I ordered this on a Sunday night, and paid the minimum shipping price. I fully expected that it wouldn't show up for a week at least (the fourth of July was the following thursday). When I got my confirmation email from Amazon they said that estimated arrival date would be the 6th-9th. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to find the case waiting for me in my mailbox Wednesday afternoon. Took two days to get here. Very nice.Quality-As I said before, I am very impressed with the quality of this case for the price. It is the soft gel feeling plastic, with a glossy finish on the sides and top and a matte black grippy finish on the back. The back is nice because when you set it on your dash board it doesn't try to slide off. You can't really see it in the pictures but it's there and very noticable in person (but not in a bad way).Needless to say, this case is a very tight fit on the phone, and everything lines up perfectly. I've noticed that sometimes on these kinds of cases that cutout for the charging port won't be quite large enough and the usb cable won't plug in all the way. That's just  the trouble with these plastic molds sometimes. That is not the case here. Perfect fit. ALL the ports are perfectly cutout.As for the power and volume buttons, instead of being covered and thus harder to press they are cutout as well. They also fit perfectly and are not hard to press at all. That camera and speaker cutout is perfect as well.This case fits the phone so perfectly it's unbelievable. Its not so tight as to be hard to get off and on but it is snug. Sometimes when I'm peeling it off it will try to take the battery cover too, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion.Conclusion-Once again this case is the highest quality case I have ever bought for this low of a price. It keeps the phone slim but also provides the needed protection that you bought it for. Awesome, awesome case. I plan on checking out more products by this company.Overall, for less than five dollars out the door you will not find a higher quality case for your shiny new Galaxy S4.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing case for the price.

Klein \"mike_in_ca\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out.Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic.  I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible.  I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked.  I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower.  I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal.  In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just \"different\" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that, I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn't like that.Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Results will vary", "unixReviewTime": 1270080000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2010"},

The little power block died at about the same time as a lightning storm went through and made our house power hiccup so I'm not sure what knocked out the block (yes, it IS on a surge protector).  I bought a variable DC power supply as a backup since I could not find a \"generic\" power supply that would work (3.6VDC, 2.0A). I also added a grounding wire on my outdoor antenna.

It does seem to take about 1-2 hrs to charge up the devices, which is as long as it normally takes when they're connected to their native chargers.These units ARE picky about battery voltages. If the AA batteries are partially discharged, it might not see them.  In terms of battery usage, using regular rechargables, you can expect to get one full charge on your phone from the batteries because of the high voltage requirement of the charger to start up.  There'll still be juice left in the AA's, but good luck getting the little chip inside these chargers to wake up.What would I like to change?  1) The very high low-voltage cutoff.  Chances are you're using these in an emergency situation when power isn't available or nearby.  These are the times when you want EVERY last ounce of power, even if it's only 5 minutes worth of charging time.  2) The charging tips are detatchable and are too easy to lose and a longer cord would be appreciated, especially when trying to talk on the phone and charge.  3) A different battery door design.

I'll get into the pros and cons below, but first I've got to say that when I started my quest to purchase a decent sounding, less than a 100 lbs, and less than a fortune set of wireless headphone, I did not expect it to be this difficult.For my music source I purchased the Verizon ENV2, and added an 8 GB chip.I first ordered the JBL 610 ($125). While they paired up perfectly, they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap. Return # 1.Next I ordered the top-of-the line Sony DRBT50 ($165). These were light weight, felt great, and when I got stereo, they sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, they would not stay in stereo mode, kept reverting back to mono. Also, the controls were badly placed and I kept hitting the controls when I put them on. Return # 2.Next came the Jabra BT8030 ($137). They paired easily and sounded very nice (they have chip enhanced bass). Also - they turn into stand-alone speakers and they really sound great in that mode. The sound level actually doubles. Unfortunately, they weighted about a ton and I felt really stupid when I walked around the mall with them on. Oh yea, the ad claimed 32 hours of use between charges, but once I got them the specs said 7-8 hours. Big difference. I thought about keeping them for the stand-alone stereo - but - back they went. Return # 3.That's when I gave up and bought a pair of Bose wired headphone (the cheap $150 pair). They sounded great and lightweight - but once I got them on the plane I remembered why I wanted wireless phones. I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. So after a couple of weeks of this, I decided to try one more time. I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805, basically out of sheer desperation. They were only $88 at Amazon (I love Amazon!), and free shipping, so I gave them a try. Surprisingly, they paired easily and sounded really good.  They were not especially light weight, but fit fine on my head and were not all that heavy (8 oz). No glitches the first 3 days, then all at once I went to turn them off, and they went in pairing mode and the only way to get them out was to plug in the charger. A couple of more days went by and one morning they would not turn on (had plenty of charge). So I decided they were defective, and I sent them back and got a replacement pair. After about 3 days with the replacement set, once again they went into pairing mode, and then later would not turn on. Hum, if it happened the same way twice, then it probably was not a defect but something I was doing wrong. So I experimented with them for a few days and figured it out. Here goes: If you follow the instructions when turning them off and wait until after all 3 flashing lights before releasing the on/off button, they will go into pairing mode. If you release the button as soon as the first flash happens, they turn off. A quirk, but, given my history and desperation, not all that hard to live with. Next, why would they not turn on sometimes? I found this one by accident. I went to turn off the headphones, but forgot to first press the music play/stop button, just turned off the phones. That did it, they would not turn back on until I plugged in the charger and \"reset\" them. Okay, for most people that would be enough to \"send them back\" but I really want wireless headphones so I am keeping them.A few other observations:(1) I tested the charge time and so far they've gone 16 hours on a single charge, and they were still working. They are rated at 17 hours. Charge takes almost exactly 3 hours.(2) A big pro is the case, hard shell and very nice. Room to store the charger and supplied wired cable.(3) They transition seemlessly from stereo headphones to hands-free phone headset. When you hear the ring tone, just press the Phone button and you are talking. Clear as a bell. Not sure how my voice is coming through, but have not received any complaints so I assume it is clear as well. When you are finished with your call, press the phone button again, and you are back to music in a couple of seconds. The music is paused so you don't miss a note.(4) The ad says they reduce noise and echo, but I did not find either of these to be true. Background noise is not noticably reduced, and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall. Does not really bother me, but you should be aware of this. Haven't tried them on the plane yet.(5) Controls: I like the placement of the controls. Took me only a couiple of days be become an expert at lowering or raising the music volume (a wheel), skipping or repeating a song (a different wheel), pausing (quick push of a button), or answering the phone (quick push of a differnt button).Okay, that's about it. I will keep them and I do recommend them if you don't mind dealing with a quirk or two. Besides, $88 (now $79 I see) isn't all that much money to be the first on your block to own some new high-tech gadget.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Forth Time's A Charm", "unixReviewTime": 1215907200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2008"},

Maxon", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "My purpose for buying the S805 headphones was to hook them up to my Home Theater so that I could watch movies, hear the PS3, and listen to music all in one place.Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well, so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me: the Bluetooth transmitter.I had the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) and figured since my Motorola S9 Headphones worked fine with it; then these Motorola S805 headphones should work fine as well. I was wrong. After spending close to an hour of transfers, hang ups, and poor English, I finally got an answer from someone at Motorola's support line: \"The S805 is not compatible with your transmitter.\" I asked them in return, \"do you sell a transmitter that will work with them?\" for which their reply was, \"Only one that works with an iPod.\"So, I had to find another alternative. Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) with success. I broke down and ordered this, investing more than I had intended, but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter. I haven't used it much to do further testing, but it seems to work fine at close range; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out, and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it. But I'm usually sitting on the couch, less than 10 feet away, and so far it works like a charm.So to sum-up:1) Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) = does not work with the Motorola S8052) Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) = does work with the Motorola S805If there are others, I'm not aware of them.Other things to note on transmitters:1) My Bluetooth dongle on the computer did not connect these headphones either. My understanding is that you must have an A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) compatible dongle for it to work.2) The PS3 may have connected the device, but I didn't try as after some research, I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection.

Motorola used the horrible \"one button does it all\" interface for operating power and pairing, even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth, but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's \"special\" headphone cable, which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me, I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last, as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed, but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable, on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Sound Difficult to Operate", "unixReviewTime": 1212624000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2008"},

After reading some of the reviews, I thought it wouldn't be such a bad buy considering the price. As the title says, these headphones do not work well with a Macbook Pro. Sure it will connect and everything, but the bluetooth setup that apple has on these laptops suck. I mean, the sound has a lot of static and cuts out. I'm not sure if its OSX that's the problem or the bluetooth radio but all I know is that the sound coming from the headphones just did not sound nice. At this point I wondered if it was the headphones or the computer. So I switched to my Compaq running Windows XP and lo and behold it sounded incredible. No static, no cutouts, nothing. The sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs. It was easy to connect and was running A2DP. I can bet that most people who rated these headphones poorly either had a non A2DP compatible source or was using a Macbook Pro. So even though I enjoy my Mac, all I can say is that apple skimps out on small things like bluetooth and to some people that means a lot. Overall the headphones were comfortable and felt very solid. The charge time is long (3 hours), but is definitely worth it. I have yet to try these with a A2DP cellphone so sorry if I don't review call quality and such. Even with my problem with my Macbook Pro, I thought that it wasn't the headphone quality that affected the sound, it was the computer and that shouldn't affect the overall rating of the headphones, so I rated these 5 stars.Pros:Cheap!Sound is impressive on both treble and bass.

(The one exception I'll explain) First of all it's super light and fits so well that you'll forget it's in your ear. Really! It feels so snug that it doesn't feel like it might fall out, unlike many others. (Forget that optional ear loop thing. It made it worse.) Second, when it needs recharging there's no need for plugging and unplugging wires. Just set it in it's case and close the lid. Take it out when it's done. (The case stays plugged in. No messing with the wire.) Third and most important to me is the sound quality. I compared these 8 headsets: Plantronics Voyager 510, Plantronics Explorer 320, Jabra BT8040, Jabra BT500, Motorola HS850, Motorola H700, Jawbone, Samsung WEP200. I compared them head-to-head by pairing two at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller compare the sound quality for both of us. I do this in a few different environments with a few different background sounds. This puppy sounded clearer than all the others except one and specifically in one situation. Here's the exception: loud background noise. Now hear me out, I work in construction and background noise is a huge issue for me at work. I've never found any headset that handles background noise better than the Plantronics Voyager 510. Not the Jawbone or anything else. So for me the Samsung WEP200 won't work. Mostly because of the background noise, but also because it's cute red color would make me stand out like a bullseye at a firing range. But, it's not for me! It's for my mom and she loves it! (and she won't be doing construction anytime soon) So if you don't have a noisy environment then I give this an A+. Yes, it sounds hollow in a car. Yes, if the wind blows straight into it the caller can't hear you. But I haven't found one that doesn't do that, and this has clearer sound than all of them. (With my one exception) Oh, one more thing. It has 4 hours of talk time which is less than the others (they range from 6-12), so if you talk a lot, for the price you can buy two.

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "helpful": [445, 448], "reviewText": "I was looking for a replacement for my bluetooth headset when I started looking at bluetooth speakerphones.  After doing some research, I was looking for the following:* No installation - I wanted to use it in multiple vehicles/locations* Reasonable price* Trusted brand* Good sound quality* Easy to useI am happy to report that the T305 does a good (sometimes great) job of satisfying my requirements.  Here's a look at how it has performed:Setup - Upon opening the box, there are really two things to do:  insert the visor clip which is easily secured and use the car charger that comes with the unit.  While the instructions said that charging could take up to two hours, my unit fully charged in about 30 minutes.  Once complete, simply power on the device, and it automatically enters pairing mode.  I was able to find it with my LG VX-9900 (see my review) with no problems at all.Use - Coming from a background of using headsets, I must say that I cannot imagine going back.  I really like not having anything hanging on my ear (and sometimes inserted in my ear depending on the headset).  This model also seems geared toward the people who use headsets because the operation is very similar.  One nice thing is that the power button is separate from the multi-function button.  With my 9900, I am able to initiate voice dialing from the speakerphone and with the 9900 set to auto-answer, calls are automatically transferred after 2 seconds.  The volume controls on the sides are easily accessible and operate similar to most headsets.  I never have to touch my phone at all so it truly is hands-free.Call Quality - All of the above is meaningless if the calls don't sound good, right?  Well, have no fear.  The call quality for both parties is better than any headset that I have ever used - and I've used six different ones over last 2 years.  Some of this has to do with positioning.  In the Texas heat, most people have their AC on a high setting.  Unfortunately, most headsets are positioned directly in line with the air flow.  However with a visor clip-on of this speakerphone, this is not the case.  Add to that the noise canceling technology, and the people on the other end hardly know that they are on speakerphone at all.  On my end, the volume is more than adequate.  It's really a simple matter of physics - the speaker is bigger here than it is on a headset.Cons - So what's the catch?  As I mentioned earlier, the device only ships with a car charger.  I ordered (rather cheaply) a wall charger to compensate for this.  While it was annoying, it wasn't the end of the world.  Others have mentioned the flashing blue light.  I have to admit that the first time I was driving in the dark, it was initially distracting.  However, I got used to it rather quickly, and I don't notice it anymore.  I would compare it to getting a new car that has a loud turn signal.  You notice it a lot at first, but you learn to tune it out.  Also, it does not have a display, but then again, neither do headsets.  Finally, I use it in a similar manner to a headset.  I take it with me when I get out of the car, and I power it off between uses.  It's not an integrated speakerphone so it isn't tied to your car's power supply like more sophisticated (and expensive) models.  None of these are deal-breakers for me.Bottom line - If you are looking for a good alternative to bluetooth headsets, and you intended use pattern will be similar to that of a headset, then this is what you are looking for.  It has great quality, and it's easy to use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tired Of Bluetooth Headsets?  Here's An Alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1192665600, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2007"},

Sometimes it take a second for it to answer a call when you click the answer button.  I guess the solution for that is probably to wait a few seconds after answering before saying \"hello\".  This flaw also demonstrates itself when using VZ Navigator, because it cuts off the first word of driving instructions.  This flaw might be from my MOTOKRZR phone and not from the T305, but I don't have any way to know which end causes it.Another reviewer stated that the \"on/off\" button is too small.  When I first read that, I didn't know why it matters.  I now know.  At least with a MOTOKRZR (and I'd assume other phones), the speaker on your phone will be inactive when it is connected via Bluetooth to your T305.  With 150 feet of range, it actually stays connected if you are 150 feet from your car.  Therefore you have to turn it off every time you get out of the car, or else you won't be able to hear calls you receive on your phone.  It isn't a huge deal, and something you can get used to, but Motorola should have either made the on/off button more accessible or cut the Bluetooth range down to about 15 feet.Overall the best handsfree solution for talking in the car.

Charme", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I was looking for a no frills car speaker to use with my BlackBerry Tour that was easily portable between different cars, easy to use, and had good sound quality for speaking and listening. The T305 did the trick.Pairing this with my Tour was quick and effortless. Using it is a breeze. I just hit the phone button to receive a call and my speed dial buttons to dial frequently called numbers. Voice activated calling also works, though I tend not to use that.This is a small unit that clips unobtrusively and easily to the visor for easy installation and removal. The people I call say that my voice is clearer than when I was using a headset. I can also hear them more clearly.Let me address some critiques mentioned in other reviews, none of which should deter you from buying this unit:1. There is no AC charger, only a cigarette lighter charger with a micro USB plug on one end. True, but there are lots of gadgets you can buy to power electronic gadgets via a USB cable and AC outlet (I own several; one of my favorites is the Tekkeon MP-1800, which I use for this unit as well as my iPod Touch, Tour, and Slacker G2).Also, if you have a USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B cable (which costs only a few dollars on Amazon) you can charge this unit via the USB port on your computer.2. The power switch is tiny. True, but it really is not difficult to turn this on and off (and it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes when not paired with your phone, which happens when you leave the car and get far enough away).3. There is a flashing blue light to indicate that the unit is connected to the phone (and my Tour also has a flashing blue light while it is connected to the speaker). True, but if it bothers you just put a piece of black electrical tape over it (though I would not cover it completely so that when you charge this unit, you can tell when the charging light turns from red to blue to indicate a full charge).4. The unit does not automatically turn on and sync with your phone when you get into the car. True, but it is not really a big deal to turn it on.Bottom line: This unit cost less than half the sale price of my fancy blue tooth headset and is both easier and clearer for me to use. In addition, since pairing with a phone is required only once, you can use this with multiple phones (though obviously not at the same time), which is handy when my wife wants to borrow it for occasional use. The only adjustment on this unit is the volume, but that is all that I was looking for. For a \"plain vanilla\" unit I recommend this.Update April 7, 2010: I now place this unit next to the center console so that I can connect it via a USB cable to a charging unit by my console that I use for my electronic gadgets, which keeps this unit charged all the time. The sound quality is still fine (I made a test call to my home answering machine). I also like not having this unit visible on my visor lest someone mistake it for a GPS and break into my car to steal it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product", "unixReviewTime": 1268870400, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2010"},

The side buttons.As of 5/22/08 I'm about ready to hurl this from the roof. The UI is just too inconvenient. I've also had to replace the battery once.6/13/08 Enough already! I replaced it with a Nokia E51. On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive, they require deliberate use, and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway. The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&T; could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&T; to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good: The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version, whatever that was called. I guess I'll eventually get used to iTap, but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say \"say a command\". Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good phone with standard Motorola issues", "unixReviewTime": 1185062400, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2007"},

No one was in sight in this bad part of town. I locked myself in and pulled out my phone to call my roadside assistance. It began to beep - dead battery warning. I had just enough power to be ON HOLD long enough to request assistance and confirm my location - Thank God. I was terrified of being stranded at night in this neighborhood. I vowed, \"Never again!\" That's what brought me here to this product. It is exactly what I need, and it works perfectly.This charger is a Godsend. I get several recharges for my RAZR V3 for each charge of the portable charger. I've had none of the problems others have mentioned. It fits perfectly in the inside zipper pocket of most of my handbags, and I am NEVER without it. I have used it several times. A full charge takes longer than a charge directly from an outlet, but you have power instantly to use the phone in an emergency. What a bargain for the priceless feeling of security it gives me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exactly what I needed!", "unixReviewTime": 1182556800, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2007"},

A square will not fit into a trapezoid, for example. A square does fit into a slightly bigger square.

It's just...come on, people. Do some research or read the product description, at least. You can get mini USB to micro USB adapters on eBay for about $2-3. You can even get a mini USB to regular USB adapter, so you can use the charger with any USB cord you have.Now, to the charger. I saw a refurb for $4 and decided to try one. It's well designed and compact, at less than three inches tall and about an inch thick. The LED indicator is easy to understand. The mini USB output slides away when not in use, which also turns off the charger to save power. Unfortunately mine only adds about 1100mAh to my phone, which isn't the 1700mAh claimed. Maybe it depends on your phone - I charged a Nexus 4 (with the adapters). And its output current is around 0.5A, so it will charge slowly - or simply slow down your phone's discharging if you're playing games or something.Currently at $6, it works out to 283mAh/$.

As far as I could find, it is the ONLY unit that works in ANY fashion. EverReady has a weird thing for $9.99 at Target, but it did not charge at all.It is small, solid and feels well made. The only moving part is the push-switch that pushes out the mini-USB to plug into the charger port on the phone. The light appropriately glows when the unit is charging and charging a phone. It is too bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket for an extended period but perfect to keep in any small carrying bag. It would fit in a typical car ash-tray.Droid X and other micro-USB port owners MUST buy a miniUSB(F)-to-microUSB(M) adapter.The unit plugs into the adapter which plugs into the phone. It does trickle charge my phone. After about 15 minutes my X went from 0% to 10%. Another 30 minutes (45 total with the phone off) was required to go to 20%. The unit is not made for the higher-powered battery type used by the X. Once I confirmed that the unit will charge the battery enough for use, I did not see how long it took to charge, how many recharges I could get, or how long the unit will hold it's own charge.Now, with that all said, the only place to comfortably accomplish this is to leave the phone and unit sitting quietly on top of a desk or other surface. While the unit plugged into the adapter plugged into the phone will fit in cargo-pants pockets or a bag, the adapter will invariably and in shortly unplug from the phone. I found myself carrying the phone with the unit in the same hand, which is serviceable and not as uncomfortable as you would think. And it did not stop the adapter from regularly popping out of the charging port on the phone (it never popped out of the unit). Using it in this fashion kept my phone operating at least 30 minutes longer than if I did not have the unit.So, the unit works. It is portable and it charges the phone.I would recommend this because the X only lasts AT MOST a day on a charge, and if you get stuck for any period of time (the essential time when you would want your phone operational) this unit, for a small insurance investment, would keep it going.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not perfect for Droid X", "unixReviewTime": 1283904000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2010"},

No degradation in performance over time as you get with the foam tipped units. Good for writing, drawing and pressing buttons. Pen works well.*Note: If you want to save money, the Targus and Griffin stylus are identical to this one. This one just has a pen built in and is MUCH nicer in terms of quality and build of product. Functionality is the same though.Just bought the Boxwave in my quest for the best stylus. This one has the rubber soft tip which I like better than the foam. I think the rubber tipped styli show more of an effort in development rather than the left over circuit foam styli that might as well tell you that you're not worth the R&D; (pogo).Out of the box this thing feels like a small to medium sized pen. It actually is an ink pen on one end and a stylus on the other. With regard to dual function styli, I like this one because the pen is capped and when you are not using it, the cap adds to the body of the stylus as if there is no separate piece.Looks great too.I have to compare it to the Targus or Griffin one because that's the closest in similarity. It does seem to be slightly more sensitive than the Targus, not deal breaker sensitive but depending on what application you are using, it could mean the difference between smooth writing and less than smooth writing. (your hand weight, writing pressure and writing style make a difference too). It's about a half an inch longer than the Targus, which gives it some nice pen like feel in  your hand.This feels more like a pen than the Targus does, and while that has to do with the fact that it actually is an ink pen as well, it's also to do with construction of the item.On tests using Penultimate, Upad, Paperdesk, Note Taker HD, and Neu.notes I found the boxwave to perform very well and objectively better than the targus. However, I think at this point that all \"rubber\" tipped styli will perform similarly and it might come down to which device feels the best in your hand. As with ink pens, how the item feels is just as important and can play a role in quality of writing as how it actually writes. In this case, both the ink pen and the stylus function work well and do their job properly. I am overall pleased with this but I am reserving jumping jacks for a few weeks of use to see how it performs after some wear.In comparison to the pogo, there is no comparison. This to the pogo is like a ferrari to a yugo. The pogo being the yugo. I would not mind if the boxwave came in a slimmer barrel and had aluminum anodized colors, but I will likely never go back to a foam tip.Saying that though, I have to say as before, your writing style will dictate which type of stylus is right for you. If given the chance, get one of each and see what works better or try them out in the store. Had I done that with the foamies, I would have stayed away, but I can see that they would work for some people.I think the price I paid for this stylus is good, but I would not pay more since I really do believe now that the rubber tip is going to be pretty much the same. Unless you pay more for aesthetics do not pay more because you believe the tips will be different, they won't be. Griffin, Targus and Boxwave rubber tipped styli are identical even down to the silver metal band that holds the tip to the barrel. Identical.I would, and probably will buy another Boxwave stylus.Pros:Good weightVery nice construction and materialsQuality feel over other brands, doesn't feel like a generic stick, actually feels like thought went into it.Ink is refillable with standard store bought refills. Included ink works well but is clearly genericMetal barrel with metal ink head. Dual O-rings on ink end prevent debris from entering barrel and keep cap tightCons:None really.

Basically it's supposed to be the stuff that is used to protect helicopter blades.Back to the WriteRight protectors, I was glad that it came in a pack of 10 becuase I knew it might take me several tries to get it to fit perfectly.  Unfortunately with my Nokia N95-3 it took me about 5 times and I still couldn't get it right.  Good thing I only need half a sheet to fit my phone's screen.  (technically I have 20 sheets) I think it's harder because my screen is surrounded by the border of the phone with rounded edges.  That makes it harder to measure the size and having to estimate the curve of the corners.  I also applied it to my girlfriend's Sidekick LX, which was much easier because of the screen.First of all, you pretty much have to get it right on the screen on the first try otherwise the more attempts you make, the more dust the adhesive side will pick up.  Secondly, there will be many air bubbles you have to try to push out.  The ones in the middle are pretty easy to push out as you apply, but the border ones are tricky.  When you try to push some of the bubbles out, it looks like is just becomes a smudge that you can't push any further.When successfully applied to the screen it looks fairly clear.  There is, however, a rainbow tint from the light when you look at certain angles.  Not a major problem.  Yes, the protector will attract dust, but I believe that is true of many screen protectors; as my previous InvisibleShield protector also did.  The protector does scuff fairly easily as well.  When I used a paper towel and alcohol to clean off the oil on my screen it left a slight scuff where I was rubbing.  None of the scuffs, smudges, or bubbles effect the clarity of the screen when I'm using the phone.  Only when the backlight is off is when I can see the imperfections in the screen protector, which is still a little annoying to me.All in all, they give you 10 in a pack probably because they expect each of them not to last that long.  If you just want a protector that will prevent your original screen from getting damaged, this will work.  But if you want absolute perfection with the backlight on and off, I am certain there are better products out there.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Wishing it was better...", "unixReviewTime": 1215907200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2008"},

{"reviewerID": "A1P5TN3N6L155V", "asin": "B000KKKI0M", "reviewerName": "Keith LeDuc \"leduckut\"", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "I really have a problem when I read these reviews, not only on this product but others as well, and I have read a lot of them, when people complain when they haven't even given the product a chance to prove its worthiness because they are way too impatient to truly check the product out. I say this because, I agree that these screen protectors do scratch really easy especially if you use some sort of \"squeegie\" to apply them with. Because of all that scratchiness, they do appear slightly fuzzy and not shiny and clear like other brands. But, when my phone is on and the LCD is lit, I see no issue what so ever. My screen is still very easy to read and appears much like it would without some sort of screen protector on. Now, the very interesting part is about the bubbles that most of you are complaining about. Yes, when I installed mine, there were a few bubbles, some smaller and one very large one. At first I was annoyed by this but you have to remember, you have to make sure your screen is ultimately clean and free of debris before you ever install these or any other brand of screen protector. Otherwise, any dust spec on your screen before you apply the protector will cause a bubble. If you touch the \"sticky\" side of the protector before installing it, this will cause bubbles and it will NOT adhere to your screen very good. But, if you have patience like me and loose some of that angriness most of you seem to put forward, I have noticed that within a few days, without me doing any other proding or scratching to try to get rid of the bubbles, the bubbles have disappeared and taken care of theirselves. Imagine that. Because of that reason alone, I will NOT be pealing this one off and trying anything else. I like that it has an extra stickiness and it stays in place really well. The fact that I can still view my screen without any differnce makes me think these aren't near as bad as some of you folks complain about. Now, I can admit that I haven't tried using my phone outside in the bright sun yet. My phone use is mostly restricted to in home use. But, I can say, as with ANY device with an LCD screen, whether it be a laptop, cell phone, Ipod, digital camera....anything with an LCD screen, you can't see them well outside anyway. You have to admit that to yourself. The brightness of the direct sun tends to fade what you see once you are outside. So those of you complaining that these protectors make too much glare (glare? really?) in the sun, I say lighten up! I had a cell phone once that when the LCD screen was exposed to the sun, the sunlight actually lit it up differently and made it easier to see outside. I had a car stereo that did the same thing...when sun hit the display, it still lit up by the sunlight so you could still see it. I feel more LCD products need to consider this, but we are not reviewing them. So anyway...I just feel you people need to lighten up and not be so critical all the time.

This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings.In the case of this \"Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,\" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a \"Cellet\" universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a \"Luxmo\" universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient \"vent.\"  Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or \"Vent Mount (non)solution.\"  So it was on to Plan B, the \"Dash Mount\" solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this \"adjustable\" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one.

Cimo had a similar hybrid with frost clear back.  Supcase had a similar product too, but the back was clear.So I took a chance.  This is a very attractive case on the One.  The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast.  There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons.  I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons.  No so with this case.  Very easy to press.The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout).  The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material.  Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description.  Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered.Case is very snug (I like that).  Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured.  There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface.Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile.This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit \"Clear\" case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of \"clear\" is actually frosted white.  And it cost $12.90.Overall, this BoxWave is great case for $5.70 that was Prime eligible.*******************UPDATE:  2013-09-28*******************I bought 2 of these cases since we have 2 HTC Ones in the family.  My case is still great.  My daughters case, on the other hand, has not fared as well. The rubber bumper has separated almost completely from the hard case after 2 months of use.

He had not previously used a bluetooth device, and I wanted to make sure that he could answer his phone without taking his eyes off the road.  Both of us were using the new iPhone 4.  So how did the Discover 665 compare to the 925?  In general, it worked well, with easy pairing and one-touch answering.  Where it lagged, however, was in audio quality. I could hear him, but he couldn't always hear me, and occasionally his transmission had some vibrato and/or muffling.  While the problem could have been with my 925, I've used it for years without such issues.  He has since used it to answer calls from our land line, and occasionally the sound quality just isn't there.So why four stars?

I don't know if there's another way to do this but once you insert that SIM card, you have to have a child take it out. Almost impossible for me to grab and pull out.- Speakerphone is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume cranked up- Vibrate on the phone is really... mild. If it's in your pocket, you probably won't feel it. Especially if you're on the train, for example.- Long boot up compared to the two non Symbian phones I had.- very annoying pop port .. i didn't think it would be an issue but if you have to hold the phone with two hands to insert your headset... annoying.- no emoticons on txt messages??!!- to reply to a txt you have to hit options->reply->via txt msg. Why can't i just hit reply and go straight to the txt box?- zoom on phone takes f o r e v e r.- where is the STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER?!- fingerprints/face prints get xfrd to phone easily- my battery life : internet use only on/off = 4-6 hours with 2 10min calls and 6hours standby; MobiRadio on speaker, continuous = 1.5hours; mixed internet, mobiradio, regular radio, phone calls, text messaging, tinkering with phone= 6 hours or so. All hours est from full charge to when the batt just dies. Includes intermittent standbys and where I just look through the phone.The charger is now tethered to my hip.Like:- really soft and big keys- ability to move around the files/ folders- Nice big screen- Video (choppy and pixelated but it will do)will con't as the months pass.....**UPDATE:-battery life has improved significantly. I still use it 13hrs a day but I now charge just once a day. And i use it more.-I also bought this primarily as an MP3 player and I'm having the same problem that I had with the 6230. The shuffle is not really a shuffle. I have about 200 songs in there and it insists on playing the same songs over and over every 10th-15th song... it seems to loop to songs I've heard already every single time.-I use the HS-31 headset that I had before and the volume is just really low. I have to roll the windows up in my car in order to carry a conversation. I thought it was just the speakerphone that had a low volume. The bluetooth earpiece was loud, though.-And finally, 3G. I found no discernable difference between EDGE and the 3G networks while downloading video or viewing webpages. Maybe it loaded up a page a few seconds faster but that was about it. Mobiradio still buffered every now and then in 3G networks so that was surprising as well.I'm still going to keep the phone, though.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ehh...", "unixReviewTime": 1181088000, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2007"},

When this model came out I jumped at the opportunity to buy them since they were the first stereo Bluetooth headset with a form factor that is appropriate for wearing in public. (Most of the other ones are too big and just scream \"Look at me, I am a dork!\") And since I bought them a little over a year ago, I have been extremely satisfied with them - for the most part. Here are a few pros and cons that I have come up with.Pros:1. Comfortable enough for a daily workout. Even with my moderately large head, I did not have much of a comfort issue with wearing them every day for a couple of hours. I would not recommend wearing them for more than three hours in a row though. But that would be the case with most headphones anyways.2. Easy setup. I had no problem connecting them to either my cell phone/mp3 player or my laptop.3. Decent range. As long as there is an uninterrupted line of sight between the linking device and the headset, you can use them on the other side of a large room or a smaller gym. Comes in handy when working out and don't want anything attached to any part of your body.4. Decent music playback sound.5. Decent battery life. For a relatively small device like this one, it was pleasing to find out that it did not have to be recharged more than a couple of times a week with standard use.6. As a phone earpiece it is useful to have around the head headset because it improves stability a lot. All of my other earpieces fall out of my ears way too easily.7. Being transferred from the mp3 player to the phone when receiving an incoming call is really useful and cool.Cons:1. It would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible. In that case they could be taken with you in your pocket almost anywhere you go. Plus, it would avoid dangers of having them twisted while stored in your bag.2. Touch-sensitive controls are too sensitive and very, very small. It took me a while to get used to them.3. The stereo feature works only for music. When using them for calling, only the left earpiece delivers sound, which is sort of weird. This takes some time to get used to.4. For some reason, when I linked them to my laptop, they got de-linked with my cell-phone. I had to go through the whole process again to have them back in the desired configuration.Unfortunately, a week ago one of the touch-sensitive controls broke, and now I can't increase the volume. This is really annoying because other than that they still work great. I tried sending them back to Motorola, but apparently they don't fix products that are bought through Amazon, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BRAND NEW! This is extremely annoying to say the least. I decided to buy a new pair, and found another one on Amazon for $50. (So if at the moment all the available ones are more expensive than that, you may want to wait a bit.) Since this price is about 2.5 times cheaper than what you could get in any AT&T; store, it seems to me a worth-while investment. I figured that paying about $50 a year for something that I get to use every day is worth it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worked fine while it worked", "unixReviewTime": 1216598400, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2008"},

This is a comfortable headset that doesn't scream for attention and allows me to have a functional hands-free phone experience. I will get right down to the pros and cons:PROS:* Comfortable to wear and stay in place.* Very good call reception quality.* Decent stereo music playback quality.* Fairly good battery life.* Universal USB charging port.* Easy pairing.* Good looks that don't look ridiculous or \"rude\".CONS:* Sometimes very poor call quality when talking. I've had people complain that they had a hard time understanding me while I'm driving (windows shut, stereo off). I think it amplifies ambient sound that will drown out voice.* Music sound quality requires a bass boost. I've found that this headset is geared more for voices in the middle and higher ranges. Music can sound tinny.* There is a need for an adjustable headband. The headset stays on, but can sometimes feel like it's flopping in the back. I have a medium (7 1/4) hat size.I don't think this product is quite \"there\", especially if you are looking to use it for phone calls. I use mine primarily with a BlackBerry Pearl and a Motorola Q and the better sound quality comes from the BlackBerry, so the type of device you are using with it does matter.Still, I received this as a gift for Christmas, 2007, and was excited at the time.

I never really thought that I'd be so happy going with a cordless headphone, but the convenience factor is amazing. When I'm in our small office, I can leave my BlackBerry sitting on my desk, and walk anywhere in the office, fill up my coffee, go to the fridge, and never drop out. Sound quality is relatively good, about what you'd expect from a headphone that is oriented towards an active lifestyle that is making some compromise on design for sound quality.The buds that will come installed are garbage. Don't even bother with them, they hurt my ears after wearing for a short period of time. Make sure you put the rubber ones that are symmetrical on. My buddy bought a \"white box\" kit from another vendor who was selling for much cheaper, and they didn't come with any of the accessories, so be careful where you buy!In regards to dropping out. Strangely, with my phone on my hip, the signal does sometimes drop out. Very intermittent, talking like a fraction of a second, but of course noticeable when you're playing music.The protrusion of the headphones from the back of the head is very pronounced. They are a snug fit going around your head, some people complain that they don't think that they will be able to get them on. I have a big head (self proclaimed) and I have no issues with that. I can't sit back on the sofa with them on because of the protrusion. Likewise, this means you can't bench press wearing these headphones.The headphones also double as a hands free headset. The mic is back near the earpiece. I didn't think that it would pick up speech very well, but it does quite a good job as a handsfree device as well. I don't recommend driving with it of course, I use it at the office. The BlackBerry rings in the earpiece when listening to music to alert you to a call. Another caveat is that there is no notification in the headset when you receive an email.I've had great success pairing these with the Jabra A120S. I actually hooked up the Jabra to the audio out on my LCD TV so I can listen to the TV (ie. play on the Wii) without disturbing others. My wife uses it for the same purpose while on the treadmill so she doesn't need to blast the volume. I used the A120 on a Creative Vision with these headphones as well. No complaints. Now that I have an iPod (wake up Apple - give us BT) I'll use the A120 for pairing when I need this style headphone.Overall the cordless convenience is very nice. They could use some refinement, but they are a nice addition to your headphone collection. I would not classify them as an audiophile headset, but an active headset that can take some light abuse.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Getting there, but not quite", "unixReviewTime": 1207008000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2008"},

I like headphones but the cord can be annoying, especially when it catches on something.  With these cordless headphones, that annoyance is gone, replaced by an occasional amazement at how nice it is to be cordless and how well they work.  They can play surprisingly convincing rock or classical music at higher volumes (though I usually listen at low-to-mid volume).I connect to an iPod (through a Jabra bluetooth adapter) and a Motorola phone, which works very well.  The links are easy to establish or restart and I have experienced almost no interference or dropping-out of the signal.  Using an adapter means you cannot control the iPod with the S9 buttons but that is a minor nuisance (though it would be nice if a new iPod had that capability).  The S9 does not play stereo directly from a Macintosh computer currently but Apple's new operating system (Leopard) is rumored to provide that capability.  The rechargeable battery in the S9 last many hours; the first charge lasted only about 3 hours, subsequent charges have lasted 5 hours or so.I have only one reservation and one wish: although they are comfortable, they do eventually hurt after many hours of non-stop wearing and I wish they were more sound-isolating (in-ear).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound & convenience", "unixReviewTime": 1181606400, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2007"},

Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...", "helpful": [36, 44], "reviewText": "40 days into using the headphones I have the same problem as many other users - the touch controls stopped working. I can't change the volume (It's stuck all the way on low!) or change songs.  Since I'm past the 30 day return period, I'm stuck.  I'll have to sent them to Moto. Hopefully in warranty.New review - ZERO stars.Following is the original review....I've been using the headset for a week, pretty much non-stop. The sound clarity is amazing. No, they're not the same as high-end audiophile quality headphones - after all the speakers are really, really tiny!  The bass suffers, but they are equivalent to any other compact headphones - minus the cables.I paired these with my Chocolate cell phone in seconds and was playing music the next minute.  Seamless control of the playlist and volume. Yes, you have to use a playlist - that's a function of the player, not the headphones.  The thing charges from the provided AC adapter  or from a USB port - handy!Since the bulk of the headset is behind the neck, the headset gets in the way on some sets.  Lat pull-downs or good mornings for example.  Tilting the head down helps this, or making sure the bar lands more on the shoulders - but this really effects the rep. I tried it a couple of routines and had pretty bad neck pain the next day.  So for those reps, the headset comes off.The soft touch buttone took some getting used to, but after a few fumble-finger attempts I got the hang of it.  The distance - well, I was in the gym and walked 20 steps from my gym bag (that's where the cell phone was) - never lost the signal!The gym is the primary reason for purchasing these. I ruined too many compact headsets over the years and finally stopped using them.  The wires would get tangled on the weight bench, it was a pain doing anything overhead, and upright rows were downright dangerous (my thumbs and elbows would snag the wires.)There are occational 1/4 second drop outs - walking into and out of Home Depot for example - they have a lot of Bluetooth devices running.  Sometimes in the mall.  If I wear them around for five or six hours I experience two or three of these dropouts, but never at home or the office. The signal comes back immediately and I never lose connection.As a Cell Phone headset - pretty bad.  When the phone rings, so does the headset.  Press then answer button on the headset and you're talking on the phone.  The mic is on the headset and you have to be in a quiet place.  I was in my car, radio off.  The person calling could hardly hear me and there was a noticeable echo.  I was not even aware of this feature when purchasing the headset, so the poor quality of the headphones as a cell phone headset is not really a negative.As other reviewers have stated, the cell phone tones, ring and sounds all come from the left speaker - not both.  I believe this is a function of the cell phone.Overall, I'm very pleased with this device.Followup: My chocolate 8500 had to be exchanged. Three times. There's a bug when it comes to MP3 files. More than 50 and the phone locks up.  The Chocolate 8500 also required a playlist to work, so the headset had to use a playlist. My new 8550 has no such limitation. I have 450 songs on the thing and no playlists.  Now it's even easier.Also, charging from a USB port.  It will NOT charge from my laptop, desktop, or car USB adaptor!

Charme", "helpful": [113, 114], "reviewText": "My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise, so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews, but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact, these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to, but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors, including very windy conditions. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this unit.  It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod, (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established), (3) select the first song, and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap, and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor, you should keep some things in mind.First, in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod, either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case, which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want), but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out, and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle, and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third, since the headphones are curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headphones, which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth, because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging, there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time, as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets, but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution, albeit not a perfect one, this is it.Update Nov. 10, 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However, I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day, the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall, and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be \"zapped\" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem, I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.Update January 18, 2009: This headset does not work with the iPod Touch 2G. Although the headset connects with the adaptor that I put in the Touch, no sound comes out. I suspect this is because the Touch 2G, unlike my iPod Nano, can play music without headphones. No idea if this headset works on a Touch 1G, though I suspect it does not.Update February 2, 2009: Building up lots of sweat that can \"zap\" these headphones is only a problem for me when I run indoors on a treadmill rather than when I run outside (even in the summer I run very early in the morning when it is still cool). The problem can be avoided by periodically wiping the headphones during a workout, but I got tired of doing that. Therefore I purchased the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones (which do have a cord, and which I have reviewed on Amazon) to use in the gym instead of this headset, which I will now use only for running outdoors.Update January 22, 2012: I recently bought the iPhone 4S. This headset works flawlessly with it. No need for a separate bluetooth adaptor and no need to enter any passcode to pair this. Just turn bluetooth on for the iPhone 4S (make sure you do this first, or pairing may not work), and then turn on this headset. Bingo! You are connected.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great wireless headphones for your ipod", "unixReviewTime": 1195257600, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2007"},

See, getting this thing apart to put it on requires supernatural skills - the same amazing skills are required to get it off once it's on your phone as well. So, yeah, before I could even get it apart to put it on the phone, my finger went through the screen protector, so that part was broken.It takes a little doing to get it on your phone. Maybe it's because I'm not actually a superhero, but after a little grunting and a lot of cursing, it was on. I snapped the screen on it and the rest of it and.... then decided to see how well I could get it off.Hahahahahaha... a bloody finger and more curse words later, it was off.It's on there now and I do have a regular peel and stick screen protector on it, so I never bothered to pick up one of the spares you can buy.It's a GOOD case, don't get me wrong.

Much to my surprise, Otterbox and their Defender Series Cases have come a long way since I contemplated ordering one a few years ago. This case is extremely thin for the protection it seems to offer. The build quality is superb and should protect the phone very well! I love the built in screen protector as opposed to trying to line up the sticky screen protectors with a few of the cheaper cases. The price seems fair as well. I paid $49.95 on Amazon. If ordered directly from Otterbox it will cost around $10 more.At the time of this post, the Lifeproof Case for the s5 has not been released. A huge deciding factor in choosing Otterbox over Lifeproof is the mixed reviews the s4 Lifeproof Case received about echoing when people try to talk to you.The belt clip seems to be nice and lock the case into place, but realistically I'll never use it. I keep my phone in my pocket. The buttons seem stiff, but from what I've read it's common at first on Otterbox cases.Overall, this case is a little pricey costing about 25% of the phone's cost after a contract renewal, but I feel it's definitely worth it (especially when you consider the alternative is paying full price for an s5 because yours broke in the middle of your contract). Lifeproof will cost you about $20-$30 more.I'll try to update this review accordingly as time progresses!*****UPDATE: 7/8/2014 - I've had this case for a little over 3 months now and I still really like it! I've only taken it off of my phone 1 time since purchasing (to clean the dust out and reset the phone by pulling the battery). It was very easy and quick to remove. This case has definitely protected my phone against my toddler's destructive ways on numerous occasions. The only problem I've noticed is that sometimes the case's buttons will slip off of the phone's buttons when I try to adjust the volume. It's not a big deal. I just hit the button again until it works correctly.The screen protector is still smooth and my finger is able to glide across it effortlessly, which is nice since I am addicted to my phone and use it almost nonstop.I've talked several coworkers and friends into purchasing this case.

I couldn't be happier with how they have worked. One minor flaw is that you have to be quite careful with the hard case snaps (slotted slip overs). They are easy to break. With such good luck on prior Defenders, I decided to get one when I upgraded to the Galaxy S5.The good news: same rugged quality of construction on the S5 Defender case.The REALLY good news: when I added the Samsung OEM wireless charging back cover, I managed (with some effort and a small compromise) to get the Defender case to fit over the slightly larger back cover. It isn't perfect, but it is serviceable. The snaps don't fully engage and there is a tiny separation at the bottom  (where the wired charging port connects), but, the case is held securely in place by the rubber/silicone wrap around. From the front, top, sides and back, the case looks like a perfect fit. All buttons and openings line up just as they should. Only by looking at the bottom do you notice the fit isn't perfect.The Bonus: The Samsung wireless charging adapter charges the S5 IN THE DEFENDER CASE!This is the unit I purchased on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So, the combination of Otterbox Defender/Samsung Back Cover/Wireless Receiver/Samsung Wireless charger, work very well together, with the slight issue of the case not fitting perfectly, but workably.

It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector. The case has 3 components to it, the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself. After the hard plastic casing is in place, the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I've tried. The feel of the softer case is great, you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed. If you have small hands, and can hold the S5 by itself, with this case you may not. This case adds a lot of width to the S5, which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on. I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner, camera, speaker and USB plug. The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides. I use the headphone jack quite frequently, so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time. The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it, but again, this bulk is noticeable. I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy. The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt. Overall this case does have everything I'm looking for: protection, added grip, and a belt holster.

Holes for the camera, flash and speaker are in the proper locations.  There are cutouts on the right side for the volume rocker and the top and bottom are fully exposed. This includes the top portion of the phone over the speakers.  This is a problem for some and I must admit that it does bother me a little when I'm placing the phone on the table face down.  There is a little bit of an edge on the sides that keep the phone raised off a flat surface (when face down).  The case adds very little bulk to the phone and I think it improves the grip of the phone.  The bare phone is a bit silky and slippery.Typically I'm easy on phones and don't need a whole lot of protection.  The exposed portions on the top of the phone do concern me and I have to remind myself not to place the phone in the same pocket as keys or loose change. Other than that the case does what it's supposed to do.

Many either don't fit, are poorly made, or have other major issues.  I've very pleased with this cases.  It fits the Droid X perfectly.  Not too loose, not too snug.  (like most leather cases, it might be a little snug for the first couple of days until it get's broken in) It has a nice, removable and very functional belt clip.  You can remove the standard belt clip and underneath is a swappable belt loot to attach it to a very wide strap.  The magnetic closure is very secure.Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, it will not fit if you already have another case or \"skin\" on the phone already.  However, I'm not sure why you would need those if you plan to carry the phone in this case.  This offers great protection.  It they had made this large enough to fit a phone with one of those on it, it would be way too loose for a bare phone.It is very well constructed with a professional looking fit and finish.  It offers great protection against bumps and fall.If you insert the phone as intended, bottom first, you cannot insert a charger cord.  Not a big deal for me.  This type of case is intended to protect the phone while on your belt, in a purse, etc.  It is not a \"keep on all the time case.\"  As such, the fact that certain ports or controls cannot be used while in the case is not an issue for me.

It is soft and supple and smells like real leather.  I don't like the square emblem they have on the center of the top flap.  I'm not sure what it is supposed to do, but it doesn't look nice.  On second thought, maybe it is to hold the magnet in place.  Even so, they could have picked a nicer emblem, or as I prefer, no emblem at all.So I have a hard cover on my phone, and with that on, it will not fit in the case.  I thought I might be able to squeeze it in because leather is somewhat flexible, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get my phone in this case.  That defeats the whole reason I bought this case.  I did take my cover off and give this case a run around the block.  It seemed to fit well with my cover off.  However,as other reviewers have mentioned, the clip on the back of this case is prone to fall off if you move in the wrong direction or sit down too swiftly.  No matter how much padding this case has, if it is going to fall off my belt constantly, my phone is bound to get damaged.I did recycle this case - I gave it to a friend that has a small enough phone to fit in this case, cover or not.  I warned her about all the flaws, but she still said she would take it off my hands.  She had an ingenious way of solving the clip that snaps out - she super glued it in the slot.

(OK, maybe I'm somewhat easily impressed) I'm using them with my Samsung U900 flip shot with a 4 gig. chip..A word of caution: Your phone (or other storage device) MUST! support A2DP(Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)  and AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile) to access all the features of this device. (or for that matter, to even work with it)..I have most of my CD collection in my phone and when listening to music the buttons ON THE HEADSET will control (in the phone) fast forward, rewind, mute, move to next song, pause, and play, even  turns off the phone speaker when active. The head set is quite comfortable (at least for me). The fidelity is on par or better than plugging directly into the phone with my wired headsets. Certainly not \"studio quality\" ,but again, quite adequate.  Stereo separation is superb..I was initially concerned about the phone working with these headphones as the phone shows NO capabilities of sending stereo music (or ANY music) via bluetooth link prior to pairing with these headphones. To wit: to my Motorola H710. After pairing with the headset, all the functions magically developed in the phone of control by the headset..The only `Cons' I can think of are [1] No fidelity control (like bass and treble) [2] I haven't yet been able to INITIATE a call with the headset playing and consequently give voice orders to my phone..Which bring me to another `plus', however. When listening to music an incoming call is indicated by a tone from the headset and may easily be answered by pushing the `multifunction button' on the headset. Surprisingly, the music `mutes' and the headphones will then serve as a fairly good bluetooth hands free communication device. There is a mic in the rt. head piece as evidenced by a SMALL hole about 1mm in diameter. I didn't expect much of communication with this mic placement, but again: big surprise! It works quite well both ways during a call. Particularly on my end due to the fact BOTH ears are participating in the conversation. It isn't as good a bluetooth -phone communication device such as my Motorola H710 ear piece, but close..When the call is terminated, the music automatically comes off `mute' and again begins to play..It does take some practice to be able to push the desired button or control on the headset, as it must be done by `feel' alone. There are four different buttons, two being a `rocker' profile. Easily learned, even by this old man..Any multifunction device most always can be outdone (on a SINGLE function) by a dedicated, single use device on the plethora of functions sometimes available. A good example is my U900 Samsung flip-shot phone. It's a 3.0 megapixel camera, a passable video cam, a very good \"MP3\" (type) player, and ,before I forget, ummmm... a very good cell phone..IMHO some of the negativity expressed in many reviews neglects to consider the INHERENT lesser capabilities of a MULTI function device. Refer to my second paragraph comment(s)..Battery life is quite good. With reasonable expectations and a compatible storage device, I think most would be satisfied with these headphones.  Emphasis on WITH A COMPATABLE A2DP/AVRCP DEVICE..Addendum 5/09- I AM able to give my phone voice commands and call initiation. This is, however, the headphones weakest feature. These headphones could stand on their flawless transmission of music alone  as far as my opinion goes. The voice commands are a non-issue for me, anyway.

While there may be better,  more expensive headsets on the market,  this was about as high as I was personally willing to go for something with no swappable battery and intended for serious use.I picked this up as part of a bundle with a Bluetooth Transmitter for my iPod,  and it is serviceable there.  The real shortcoming appears to be the transmitter,  which is not particularly strong.This review is strictly about the Headphones,  however,  which are pretty close to excellent.There are certain compromises purchasing headphones;  larger,  over the ear style ones are better but heavier.  Smaller,  in-the-ear style ones tend to provide less in terms of quality audio,  and are most likely worse for your ears in general.These are  \"street style,\"  which may not contour to your head if you have a larger one.  Despite this short coming,  they probably provide the best balance between size and sound.  Clip-ons always fall off my hears,  and over the ear headphones block out too much noise when I am outside.  While I appreciate my music,  I appreciate not being run over much more.The sound on these headphones is particularly good compared to a similar price range.  Use with a portable media device will depend on the transmitter;  while my iPod and transmitter struggle to broadcast from my pocket,  the headphones will receive music in fine quality from as much as 30 feet away (standard distance for a Class II Bluetooth device).  Similarly,  I can stream music from my PC anywhere in my apartment.While I did not buy this primarily with phone usage in mind,  the unit's microphone is solid and the noise cancellation is some of the best I've used.  My friends usually cannot tell if I am at home or out on the streets,  barring heavy wind or a semi driving by.  Compared to the bluetooth earpieces I've used in the past,  the reception is stellar.  Not only do I no longer have to raise my voice,  I can speak in rather quiet tones.  This was a pleasant surprise,  considering this was not the reason I made my purchase.Active Battery Life easily trumps eight hours new;  over time,  expect the batteries in a bluetooth unit will deteriorate,  and most cannot be replaced.  Expect two years of battery life from such a unit,  with some deterioration towards the end (depending on use).  Standby time is a little dodgier,  and extended time off the charger may limit usage.  If I charge the unit in the morning or overnight,  I can get a full day and change,  even with heavy use.  Unfortunately,  this appears to be the only way around the drain on the battery.The headphones also support multiple devices at once.  For example,  you can run a music device and a phone through the same unit,  provided they support the right profiles.  I stream music with an A2DP profile through my iPod or PC while also using my mobile phone.  This can cause minor disruptions to the music,  however.  Interruptions are usually minimal.  The headset features controls for fast forward,  rewind,  play/pause,  volume,  and talk/end/voice dial for phones.  A compatible device can be controlled with only the headset,  meaning your phone or music player can be tucked away and still managed.The features,  sound quality,  and reliability far outstrip any problem I have with the neckband.  If your head is larger than normal,  expect the earpieces to shift around,  and possibly discomfort if worn for several hours at a time.  When not in use,  I usually let them rest around my neck instead.The type of headphones one uses is a personal choice,  but if you prefer the \"street style\" to clip-ons,  earbuds,  and studio/monitor style over-the-ear headphones,  this is a great device for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid product,  not intended for larger heads", "unixReviewTime": 1270252800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2010"},

I ran across these on Amazon, and decided to give them a whirl, even though they seemed too cheap (as in inexpensive, not poor quality) to be any good.I'm extremely glad I took the chance!

I only have to charge them once a week (I listen probably only a couple hours a day, and not every day, so take that for what it's worth), which is great.

Still, I've gotten pretty adept at controlling my music with them.I have not tried them for phone calls - I tend to like to use the phone directly while at work, so I can't say how well the microphone performs.Overall, I'd say these are a great find, especially when you consider how expensive wireless headphones tend to be.

{"reviewerID": "A2ARDVMUGDFED6", "asin": "B000PCCLPU", "reviewerName": "MiRSD", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "UPDATE 11/23/2010: The DRBT50's now have more (and less!) functionality when used with the iOS 4.2+ software. You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders (previously the volume bar changed to say \"DRBT50\" and you had to control it using the headphone controls). You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers (a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers. You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls. You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect, unfortunately (other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on).Unfortunately, this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers. If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up, the sound will come out of the ipad (you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up!) Even worse, other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones (which previously worked perfectly). The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case, and it's something that needs to be fixed.Original review:I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad, mainly for peace of mind. I like listening to music on my iPad, but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something. I get that \"If I had just rolled my chair out, the iPad would've gone crashing down\" feeling. Whether it's with short cords or long ones (long cords have the problem of being too long!). I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but didn't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that, that I've found.Pairing is rather quick  (but you will need to read the manual on how to do it). Unfortunately the iPad doesn't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on, but connect them in the Settings -> Bluetooth option. Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day. (UPDATE: I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options!)Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely (a big problem with the other headphones).The controls on the side are a nice idea, but more trouble than they're worth (at least to me). They're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one. Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad (only the VOL+, VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work). No big loss since the controls are so hard to find (they're behind the ear). (UPDATE: The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist, but definitely do-able (especially for volume)When paired with the iPad, it \"takes control\" of the volume (so you need to use the iPad to change the volume). See the product image I've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I've heard complaints that it doesn't block out noise as good as it should (while I don't use it in the loudest places, I found it to block out most noises - not \"noise cancelling\" though). Bass could be better, but overall not bad. Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone, but it's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device (like a home theater).I havent used it as a headset yet, but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range.

The only thing I didn't like was having the wired headset even though the cord was long enough I kept jerking the cord during my runs pulling the ear buds out.  I needed a different solution and figured bluetooth headsets were they way but I did not want to lose stereo capabilities.  Enter the BT8010.First off, the BT8010 can be used as a one-ear mono headset like all the other BT headsets.  This is great because I can still use the headset when driving.  Unlike some of the other stereo headsets such as the Plantronics you can't wear them when driving.Then, when I need stereo for running, I just plug in the left ear unit into the mono headset.  So there is a wire but it is only behind my head connecting the left & right parts of the headset.The headset grips the ear really well so even during a run the headset stays in place.  This was what I was hoping would happen so I was very happy with the results.  And the speaker that fits into the ear is comfortable (for my ear at least).Pairing the headset to the 700p was not difficult.  In order to get stereo out of the 700p one has to download the Softick Audio Gateway which supports A2DP streaming to BT headsets.  That's just because the Treo 700p doesn't support A2DP over BT natively.Paring the headset to my Thinkpad running Windows XP Professional was painless and quick.  Now when I'm working I can stream music to my headset from the laptop and when a call comes in on the 700p it pauses the music and switches to the phone!  When I hang up on the call the headset returns to the laptop, un-pauses the music and I'm back to listening to music.  While I know most BT headsets can do this I was amazed the first time it happened.The battery life seems to be very good for my usage (40+ minute run listening to stereo plus about an hour of talk time a day).  The mono headset charges via the USB port which I connect directly to my laptop. Jabra supply a power brick for charging from a wall outlet but I don't see myself ever using it.The stereo left ear piece doesn't need charging as it picks up electricity from the mono headset via the wire.The mono headset also has volume control on it (the round silver thingy) which is nice, again for running, not having to mess with the phone to adjust the volume.I haven't had any complaints about the sound of my voice when talking on the phone.I tried to see out how far I could go from the devices and it was different for each one.  With the Treo 700p I could only go about 5-10 feet and I could hear crackling.  I could go about 20 feet from the laptop.  I was hoping to be able to go further but I guess that is just the characteristics of low powered BT.I've also tried the mono headset out in the Toyota and could hear clearly even with the noise around me.  Now I am truly wireless in all possible ways.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works well w/Treo 700p & my laptop even when running!", "unixReviewTime": 1170806400, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2007"},

I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of the better stereo bluetooth headsets", "unixReviewTime": 1285200000, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2010"},

I used my other bluetooth all the time for work (to connect to my iPhone and my MacBook Pro) and having a stereo headset available for conference calls and product demonstrations would have been really nice. Anyhow, enough about me and my usage habits. Here's my review:3/5 stars.It's a solid product, but I experienced myriad problems trying to keep it connected to my MacBook Pro and my iPhone. Other users on Amazon have praised it's rock-solid connection, but I did not share their luck. While the pairing process itself was simple, it failed to stay connected to my MacBook for longer than 5 minutes (very annoying when you are trying to watch a product demo that is 30 minutes long and your headphones continuously cut out). I had slightly better luck with the iPhone. It would stay connected for up to 30-40 minutes (a MUST for long conference calls), but it was totally unreliable after 40 minutes (I had it drop out on two different hour long+ calls last week).Connectivity issues aside, it's a real solid performer. The call quality was excellent when connected. I was told that my voice was noticeably better (than my old Motorola bluetooth). Likewise, when I could get the headset to stay connected to my MacBook Pro, the stereo audio was more than acceptable for a bluetooth connection. It even had more base than I was expecting.Battery life is also quite good. I was using it nearly 3 hours a day between calls and computer usage and I only found myself charging it every 3-4 days.Another nice feature is the screen. I know it seems silly to have a screen on something that is attached to your head most of the time you are using it, but I really underestimated the utility. I actually stopped carrying my phone around the office and just took the headset. I could see caller ID, check bluetooth battery life, and even dial from the (small, but amazing for a bluetooth headset) internal phonebook.The one serious issue besides the connectivity that I had with it was how it sat on my ear. It takes a while to figure out how to put it on (HINT: when you put it on, swivel the ear hook towards the front end of the ear piece, put it next to your ear, and swivel the hook back over your ear like you're locking handcuffs). It's important to note that you shouldn't try to fit the little speaker unit inside your ear (even though it TOTALLY seems like it should go in). If you follow my hint above to put it on, the speaker will just sit outside your ear comfortably. If you try to fit it inside your ear, there is a little nub that will poke the inside of your ear and begin to hurt after just 1-2 minutes of use!!!All told, this is a great headset if you can get it to connect. As Mac/iPhone user, I had a helluva time. I'll still use it as a back up. I mean, c'mon, $20 for a stereo bluetooth headset? That's just a crazy good deal. But I will be getting another headset that is more reliable.As a side note, I never once in the entire 1.5 years of using it, lost connection with my Motorola H700 (for any reason other than the battery dying while it was on). In the week that I've had the Jabra BT8010, I've lost connection 23 times (that I remembered to count).I recommend this as a buy to any PC/non-iPhone user (or any Mac/iPhone user who is a glutton for punishment).One more thing.

Of course now it has come down in price drastically and became too good of a purchase to pass on.The order arrived early and my only complaint with the seller is that they repackaged the headset.This device works great as a hands free driving device and if you want to listen to music you just attach the external ear speaker.  Because it can be use both ways is one of the reasons why I bought it.The fit can be a problem if you do not like the hook over your ears and you may have to spend some time adjusting the device each time you put it on so that it is at least tolerable if not comfortable.  This goes for the main unit and the external ear speaker.  Do not be afraid to try each unit on your other ear as it may give a more comfortable fit.The sound is good and will keep you entertained but if you are a an audiophile use a good wired headset.  While the sound is good it is at times tinny and missing the base.  Considering though this is a device you wear out on the street, the background noise is probably ruining your perception of the sound anyway.This is a great device and considering how much it costs is a great value.

It was easy to pair with a cell phone and we experienced no major issues using it. My wife, a heavy phone users was able to wear and talk trough the BT5020 for hours without experiencing any discomfort.With one exception which I will discuss below all the specs listed in the Amazon's fact sheet are accurate and I see no reason to retype them as part of this review. I should add that the BT5020 'remembers' up to 8 paired devices and, according to the manufacturer, it can sustain connections with 2 devices at the same time. I did not test this feature.What you get:- The Bluetooth headset itself.- 110-220V charger- Short USB (Type A/Micro-B) cable for charging off a computer.- Small Quick Start Guide with graphic illustrations showing buttons, pairing and how to wear it.- 2 silicone gel earplugs to be used with the headset.What I liked:- Comfortable wear.- Light weight.- Long battery life.- Short charge time.- Flexible charging options (charger or off a PC via USB)- Relatively good quality sound - I did read the other reviews but my wife is very pleased with the sound quality and she's a heavy, constant user.Issues:- Lacks a storage case.- There seems to be no way to replace the headset vibrating on incoming calls with maybe a beep. My wife likes the vibration feature but I can't stand it and I would have rejected this if it was for me.- Seems to be a subset of a Jabra product with one essential component missing (see below).Unbundled item:The Amazon page states lists among features the following:\"Multipoint connections, allowing simultaneous connection to phone and PC\" and \"The headset features Jabra's Multipoint connection functionality, enabling it to be connected to two devices at the same time--such as a PC and a phone, or music player and phone.\"The above apply to a product named \"Jabra BT5020 Multiuse WITH BLUETOOTH HUB\". I could NOT find a listing for the plain BT5020 at the Jabra Web site, indicating that the product was either discontinued or that this 'exec package' offer is not part of the official Jabra product line. For THAT product (Multiuse with Bluetooth Hub), the specs page states correctly that \"It connects wirelessly to your Bluetooth mobile phone and simultaneously to your corded desk phone via a discreet Bluetooth hub for ultimate convenience and ease of use with none of the hassle of changing headsets.\"It should be well understood that this package does NOT include the Bluetooth Hub.Rating:As Bluetooth headsets go, this is a good one and my wife will keep it.

I've walked at least 20 feet away from my phone before I heard any crackling. It even worked well when I went outside the room.I've never had a BT headset before but I had heard that you really need to have an \"In-The-Ear\" type of earpiece for you to hear anything above a silent room. I thought I might not like the fact that this unit didn't have an gel earpiece. I do use a custom-fitted earpiece in my job to monitor audio so I know what it's like to depend on one. But I found that this one worked very nicely without one. I was able to hear quite well in my car and other noiser vehicles. It also doesn't completely block out the surrounding noise when it's not in use. It does come with a directional condom like device but found that it was not necessary even in a loud, bare walled, cargo van (which is pretty noisy on a freeway).The fit is nice. While I do know that I have it on. It may become less noticable as I use it further. It took litle practice to get to the point of slipping it on my ear with one hand in less than a few of seconds.I think I would have preferred the buttons (at least the \"answer/end\" or volume buttons) on the side of the unit rather than the edges but I'll get used to them eventually.I haven't tested the mic in windy conditions yet but in a typical situation inside and outside the audio seemed good considering the mic is no where near my mouth. I'm not sure how it will perform when I have more ambient sound when I make a call though I've not had a problem when I used it in a grocery store.I haven't used it long enough to comment on quality of build. I hoping I can take a beating though it does seem somewhat delicate.I wish the charging port was mini USB but it's even smaller than that. Like a submini USB port if there is such a thing. It does come with a USB charging cable and fortunately I had a cigarette lighter plug with a USB port built in so I can attach the cable and charge it in my car. Unfortunately the cable is only 12 inches long so attaching it while driving isn't easy.Overall, I like the design, fit and sound.

I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price.

{"reviewerID": "A2DNID0AN8FPUO", "asin": "B000Q6R4MK", "reviewerName": "Jonathan Stauffer \"Jonathan\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "I bought this speaker phone about 3 months ago. I used this speakerphone successfully with the original Motorola Razor and now the iPhone 3G. If you don't want to read my detailed review, then just read the short Pros and Cons section.CNETs review of the speaker phone is accurate:[...]Cons:1. Speakerphone has slightly squishy volume buttons.2. Protruding antenna could possibly break if handled carelessly.3. Flashing blue light.Detailed Explanation1. CNET says \"speakerphone has slightly squishy buttons\". This refers to the volume buttons on top of the unit. I didn't think this would be a big deal, but I noticed that it was hard to know if the volume button was actually pressed. There was no click or anything like that. As a result, the volume button ended up breaking because I was probably applying a little too much pressure. No worries though, Amazon has an excellent product return service and you don't have to pay for the shipping. They ship you a new product immediately and then you have some time to ship the broken product back to Amazon. I received the new speakerphone first and then I shipped the one that broke. Excellent service from Amazon, but remember to keep your box and shipping papers for a little while so that you can use those in case of a return.  I contacted Blueant support, but they were going to make me pay for the return shipping. The moral of this story is to go easy on the volume button, even when you don't notice that the volume is increasing at first.2. I've had no problems with the antenna. However, I can see that it may be susceptible to breaking if you're not somewhat careful when turning the unit on/off. I suggest using two hands when your turning it on/off. Slowly push the antenna in all the way until you hear a click sound and then you're done.It's actually kind of nice because the microphone on the antenna is protected from the environment (like dust) when the speakerphone is off.3. To be honest, I don't notice this at all (even during the night). The light is NOT bright. I have a scion TC car and the speakerphone is pretty close to my head (compared to a large SUV or truck). It still doesn't bother me at all. Don't put too much stock in reviews that tell stories of a blue light menace. If for some reason it does bother you at night, then you may consider flipping your visor down so that the speakerphone is between the window and the visor. This will block the light. If somebody calls, then flip the visor back.Pros1. Excellent sound quality. Noise and echo cancellation works great. Very clear.2. Full duplex.3. Very loud.4. Extremely long battery life.5. Great for conference calls.6. Fast connection to bluetooth compatible phone. Works great with iPhone 3G.7. The black device looks very nice.1. The sound quality is superb. Most of the time people don't even know that I'm in the car. However, the sound quality is limited to the sound quality of your phone. If you are having major problems with the sound quality, then test the speakerphone on multiple phones. Most likely the problem is with your phone and not the speakerphone. Another IMPORTANT note: the microphone on the antenna must be within about a 45 degree angle of your head to get the best results. For example, if the speaker phone is on top of your head, then obviously you won't get as good of sound compared to the speakerphone being in front of you. The directions that come with the phone show a diagram of where the speakerphone should be relative to your head for best results.2. Full duplex means that if two conversations overlap, then both people will be able to hear what the other is saying. This makes conversations more natural. If you don't have full duplex (like the motorola speakerphone doesn't have it), then it leads to some awkward conversations because only one voice gets through when conversations slightly overlap.3. The speakers can be turned up very loud. No problem hearing your phone calls. No need to get a speakerphone that connects to your car stereo. This speaker is loud. The speaker is better than most speakerphones out there.4. The battery life can easily last a month even when you are using it almost every day. It comes with an A/C adapter charger and a car charger.5. I work from home sometimes and use the speakerphone for conference calls. It works great. I can be typing on my computer and talking to somebody as if they were right there. The noise and echo cancellation makes this a better alternative to using a regular home phone speakerphone or cell phone speakerphone.6. Follow the directions the first time you setup a connection between the speakerphone and your cell phone. After that, all you have to do is get into your car and turn on the bluetooth speakerphone and it will automatically connect to your cell phone. This works for both the motorola razor and the iPhone 3G phone. For the iPhone 3G, you have to make sure that that the bluetooth is on. Then turn on the speakerphone, and the connection will be automatic.7. The speakerphone is small and sleek looking.Should I buy this one or the or the new Blueant supertooth light bluetooth speakerphone III?The speakerphone III is a good speakerphone, but I recommend this one. The speakerphone III speaks the caller's name when they are calling you. The voice sounds like a machine and doesn't flow very well. I listened to a youtube videos of it. If I really need to, I can tell who is calling me just by taking a glance at my phone. In short, I decided that the extra money for the speakerphone III isn't worth the new features.

I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2, or what.  But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now, so I don't really need it any more anyway.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit, which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office.  It makes a definite difference.  Not huge, but big enough to meet my needs, and well worth the price.I work out of my home office, and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly.  Standing out on my sidewalk, I get three bars.  In most of my house, I get 2 bars.  For whatever reason, sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars, but usually only one and sometimes none.  After adding the zBoost, I always get two bars at my desk, which is a critical difference.  I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk, but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars, because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good.I found the setup pretty straightforward, with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well, even to a slick surface.  I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base, attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties.  Fortunately, the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great.It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions, which are pretty scanty, on the back of the box.  My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up), and the two are ten feet apart, give or take a couple of inches, and have a clear line of sight between them.  I sit midway between the two, i.e., five feet from each.  Both base and antenna are vertically oriented, if that makes any difference.  The idiot light on the base is always green.It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first, and only then plug in the power. The light will be red, and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers, etc.  Once it turns green, you can accurately guage the results.So, just three stars, because I had hoped for more bars, but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me.  I would recommend this device to anyone with similar needs - just keep your expectations modest.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Pretty good performance, makes a critical difference, delivers value", "unixReviewTime": 1257206400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2009"},

My office does not have an outside wall, and I was getting zero to 1 bars without it. When I first installed this, I was able to find a location next to the ceiling where I had two bars consistently. I located the window unit there, but even though my phone showed 2 or 3 bars, my calls broke up severely.A few days ago, I put the window unit above the ceiling, where I had three bars, and it started working. However, the only way it works is if I leave my phone sitting next to the antenna, and use my bluetooth. If I move my phone as little as 6\" away I go to 0-1 bars. Any farther and I have no bars.My other big problem is that if the antenna is too close to the window unit, there is a back feed, and it stops working. That wouldn't be a huge problem, except the wire isn't all that long, and once you run it down the wall, and across the room, it is nearly impossible for it not to pick up the antenna and it stops working. Since installing it in the ceiling this problem went away, but I can no longer run the wire all the way to the floor and over to my desk. It looks pretty bad, and it may cause me problems with my boss. I wish I could add another 12-20 feet so I can install it neatly.Bottom line. If you don't have at least 3 bars where you locate the window unit, and you can't leave your phone sitting next to the antenna, then I would recommend you stay away from this item. One other comment is that I think it should be designed to work the other way around. The black antenna should mount on the window and the main unit should be located near the phone. Running both power and the antenna wire into the ceiling or to a window is just plain stupid.

You setup the main box in the area that gets coverage (for instance the main floor of your house), and the remote antenna in the nearby area that does not (basement, garage).

I contacted customer support and requested a replacement (a painless process, they were very responsive).Now that I have received the replacement, I understand why the reviews are either 5-stars or 1-star: the device I initially received was completely defective.

I had to practically hang my head out of a window to talk longer than 1 minute. After doing some serious research, I decided this was the most inexpensive solution that didn't require a physical connection to my cell phone.There are 2 pieces - a larger unit that is placed in a window and attached to the glass via 2 suction cups and a plastic antenna that connects to the unit via a long cord and also has 2 suction cups on the back. The window unit is powered by the included power supply, so you need to place it in a window that has an electrical outlet nearby.The only instructions are on the back of the box - just 3 steps. Personally, I would have appreciated a little more in the way of set-up and troubleshooting instructions, hence my 4 star rating.Be ready to spend some time figuring out the best location for the unit and the antenna. A lot depends upon where the nearest tower is and what kind of obstructions are between you and it. I put mine in a couple of different windows before I hit on the one with the best reception. Then, you need to place the antenna at least 10 feet from the window where the amplifier is. That entails figuring out how to run the long antenna cable so that it isn't in the way. Right now, I have the antenna attached to the glass on some artwork but I will probably glue or tack the suction cups to the wall when I am sure I like where it's located.The unit in the window has an LED that glows green or red. If you place the antenna too close to the amplifier, it flashes red to indicate it's not working. When you move the antenna, you will need to unplug the amplifier and then plug it back in so it will reset itself and tell you if the amplifier is far enough away.Lastly, you must be within 6 feet of the antenna for it to work properly. That in itself requires careful thought as to the placement of everything. You want it to be in an area you are comfortable taking all of your calls from.That's it. When you get everything set up, it will work to amplify whatever signal you normally get. (Note - if you had no signal before, this will not give you a signal. It only amplifies what signal you already have.) I noticed immediate improvement. My calls don't have a lot of drop outs now and the call doesn't drop after a minute or two. The call quality is very good, also. Of course, I must stay within 6 feet of the antenna, but for $60, I can live with that.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Inexpensive solution that works for me", "unixReviewTime": 1255996800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2009"},

On top of it all, I spent a good $16.99 for it with no additional features worth mentioning except that it had a clip on it just like any other pocket pen.I looked around Amazon and came across this pen.  I was intrigued by the fiber mesh construction at the tip.  I was, however, a little wary about the price that it was going for, especially seeing that it was nearly half what I paid.My fears proved to be unfounded.  The fiber mesh construction at the end is more than just a gimmick; it works.  Just the feel of the construction at the tip makes me feel pretty reassured that this pen is going to last me quite a bit longer than the other pen.  I have tried it on both my daughter's Samsung Tab 2 and my Kindle Fire HD and they both respond instantly and fluidly to the pen's touch with no interruptions/stuttering.Included with the pen are 3 lanyard attachments.  Two of them feature 3.5 mm jack plug-ins...you can use the headphone jack of your tablet to secure your pen if you feel inclined.  It works, but I worry about the plastic construction of the jack insert.  Although it has not happened, I fear that if something were to snap off the cord, then fishing that piece of plastic out of the 3.5 mm jack would lead to a not-so-fun day.  The third just has rings at either end.  Personally, I don't find myself needing any of them, since I don't find myself in a situation where I need to just have it dangling off the end.

You lug the Kill-a-watt into your power outlet. Then you plug your electronic toy into the Kill-A-watt! That's it! Instantly the device starts figuring out how much electricity the electronic object is using - EVEN WHEN IT IS OFF. A lot of devices like cell phone chargers sit there drawing electricity all day long.For example, I leave my laptop plugged in all day. I have it \"shut down\" - but it's plugged in. It turns out I'm paying $3.76 a month to have it sitting there. I know that might not sound like a lot, but if you start multiplying that by all the other objects in your house that stay plugged in, it can add up quickly.Just how much is that old computer of yours costing you? It might actually be MUCH cheaper to buy a new one that consumes far less electricity, rather than powering the old behemoth every month! You could be amazed at the amount of money you can save, just by unplugging some things when they're not in use. Invest in some power strips with on-off buttons. Turn them to OFF when the items are not in use, and see your savings soar.I love that you can program in your current electrical cost - this is always found on your electrical bill. So for my home in Massachusetts that is $0.187 per kwh. The device then lets you see - at the touch of a button - how much the current object will cost you each hour, each day, each month, each year.

Serious home-economics business. The big ones I was worried about were entertainment center with Wii, stereo, etc. \"on idle\", a laptop station in another room that is often left on and then finally I just installed a window A/C unit in our bedroom to avoid paying for all-night whole-house A/C when we are only in one room (childless couple as you may have imagined).Anyhow, the entertainment center turned out to be costing us something like $15...per year. A buck and change a month. Not worth the hassle of fooling with, but I did put the Wii, amp, preamp and various disc players on a single switch on our uber-power supply in order that we can squelch even that.I did some preliminary stuff around the house...lots of stuff like *newer* cell phone chargers draw almost literally nothing. I think it was $1.76 per YEAR *when charging* for our cell phone chargers...a pittance at cents a month. When phones are not plugged in, our chargers drew only LED power...i.e. unregisterable as it was less than one-tenth of a cent an hour.So...mostly just confirmation that a lot of the potential \"vampires\" out there really aren't.BUT...WOW...in some cases, you must be careful...We stuck our Bunn coffeemaker in the thing. The numbers started ratcheting up...fifty dollars per year...seventy...one hundred and twenty...one hundred and fifty... OH MY GOODNESS...The Kill A Watt EZ works on averaging over time, I realized we had *just* turned this thing on and it was going from cold to \"heat water up - QUICK!\" mode...in other words, drawing lots of power. That said, while Bunn coffeemakers I believe make the best tasting coffee and quick, they do the \"quick\" part of that by leaving the water heater on standby mode, always heating the water up as it cools.Naturally, I have always wondered about how much that sucker costs per year. I think I will feed it some water and let it run for a few days to get an averaged yearly cost. Should be interesting and if Amazon lets me I will report back.Secondly, another issue: I plugged this thing into our turned-off Oster blender...this is one of the classic vintage style blenders, if that matters at all...and it was reporting something like $4.75 per month, IDLE. Weird.Then, after a bit, that number started dropping...and dropping...and dropping.Perhaps when it first starts, there is some big surge that runs through it that was taking a while to be diluted by the draw-per-minute averaging in the Kill A Watt EZ.Anyhow, I really think that thing uses nothing when plugged in and idle.*** The important point to the blender example is that there will be a temptation to perform quick-hit analyses on your appliances, but this is not always the best strategy. This thing will give an accurate yearly cost for something that draws consistently, but anything that has a weird spike when first plugging it in or that turns on and off in terms of draw, like a Bunn coffee maker's water heater or a window A/C unit that blows cheap fan constantly, but turns on it's power-consuming compresser here and there must be left on for a while to get that averaging going. That is the only way you'll get an accurate and realistic actual-use cost. ***Microwave was also basically nothing year-long when not in use...I think it was one dollar a year, maybe. It was apparently just powering it's little calculator-style LCD display, and that was it. The power gets sucked during cooking, but how many minutes per day are you doing that?A floor fan costed $11...per year...to run continuously. The way we were using it, it was probably costing us $4.50 a year...and to think I used to get upset if one of us left it on all day. HA!My InFocus projector (800x600 DLP projector) draws 1 cent per hour. Well, wow, that shocked me. I left that on for a while and it still reported 1 cent per hour. Good stuff! I am sure they will come out with LED projectors that use 1 cent per 10 hours, but until that time, I have no good reason to switch or upgrade...power is cheap.(Oh, forgot to mention, power is 12 cents per kWh where I live at the moment...price your own accordingly).Oh, that window A/C unit is - I think  - about 8,000 BTU and  came in at thirty-six cents per night. I am sure our A/C for the house was running at least dollar a night, judging by our bill, so this should save us 60% (36 cents instead of a buck) of about half of our bill (since 8 hrs we use A/C wall unit, 8 hrs we use whole-house and 8 hrs it is OFF completely during the day when we are gone). So 30% savings right off the bat...and that will pay for the A/C wall unit very quickly.In the final analysis, there wasn't much adjustment made. This thing did not really directly pay for itself monetarily, but in terms of peace-of-mind, it definitely helped. I think our major expense is air conditioning, and after two months of our bill jumping over 50%, I am hoping the use of the window unit solves our energy \"crisis.\" I sure couldn't find anything else (plugged in anyways, hardwired is another story) that seemed to draw anywhere near significant amounts of power.The Kill A Watt EZ was worth it for me as a \"peacemaker\" - both with myself and with my wife. The peace-of-mind was easily worth the thirty bananas it costed, and the hour-day-month-week-year calculations are WELL worth the ten or twelve more bones you pay for the \"EZ\" model over the regular P4400...if I had to do it all over again, I'd still pick the P4460...well worth the hassle savings. The criticisms about it being hard-to-read and the solution to stick it on an extension cord (I used a power strip, which was perfect as it was short and highly portable versus a big bulky three-prong extension cord) are both spot on.Well done, P3, for a great product.

Every improvement had paid for itself and sheer curiosity led to the P3 International Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor.I plugged the power strip for my home entertainment center into this after plugging in my local utility rate, and then sat by with bated breathe waiting for the initial estimate. Nothing came through. I found out that this needed to run for at least a couple of days before it would come up with a number. Once I got a number I left it plugged in for a month and then checked again. Overall, I was very pleased. We have a 42\" HDTV, HD-DVD player, xbox 360, stereo receiver with two speakers, Cable box, CD player, and a Squeezebox Duet system. Annually, the total cost is $54. I felt that was very reasonable, and it was nice to have a number. Next I plan to plug it into a lamp, and since all of our lamps are using the same bulb, I will be able to get a very good estimate of their annual (average) cost of operation as well.If you're a big numbers person, or are looking to find ways to reduce your energy cost, this could lead you in the right direction, and it's a fun gadget to have.Cons: screen is not too bright, and if you have it plugged in low behind things, it's hard to get to and read. Solution: buy a power strip liberator.I think that the power companies should rent and/or loan these out to their customers (with a deposit of course).

First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near.Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer.

I wanted to protect this investment and, as usual, I like to get critical feedback from people whom actually have the product and can attest to its value.After purchasing the swivel case and screen protector, here's my initial observation for the past two weeks.Excellent.  The case was a better cover that the one supplied by Blackberry.  The magnet encased arm snaps and hold the phone snuggly in place.  Some times, I twirl the phone around in my hand, just to see where gaps would form.  The combination of the magnetic strap and the elastic sides keeps the phone in place securely.I had to resolve an annoying problem that evident with the phone itself and not with the accessories: slippage.  With the 7100, the design had a loop at the bottom of the phone where you could (and I did!) rig a wrist strap.  I looped the wrist strap into the old 7100 case and it never fell out.  That's part of the reason I had the 7100 for 4 years.However, there is no place to put a wrist strap on the Curve so, I bought a skin.  Well, how does the skin work with the holster and screen guard?Perfectly!  The black skin and the black leather holster really enhances the look and the feel of the phone (too bad it's not 3G!.)  With regard to earlier commentators dislike for it-- I found the phone to fit more snuggly.  The difference between having and not having the skin on in the holster is negligible at best.  In fact, it's an added benefit because if you put the phone down and it falls off the table on to whatever surface--think the concrete surface outdoor-- if that phone falls diagonally, you will see a dent or a crack in the phone.  Having the skin on prevents that.About the belt clip being useless--NONSENSE!  It has a very strong spring. You want it to be tight so the phone and the holster itself won't spring off when you bump against something or someone.  Taking mass transit here in Miami, I can attest to phone clips popping off while rushing in and out of trains.This leather holster is a good deal whether you buy other accessories for the Curve or not.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Blackberry Curve Leather Swivel Case: It's a good deal: A Critical Review", "unixReviewTime": 1231718400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2009"},

With the rebate making this headset well under $[...], it's a fantastic value.  It is not however, without some problems.PROS:- Excellent sound quality on both ends- Good battery life- Good build quality- Good range- Very small- Good looks- Multiple ear gel sizesCONS:- Redial button too easy to activate accidentally- Cannot charge without charging case- No multipoint connectionI have an old Logitech Mobile Freedom bluetooth headset I purchased nearly two years ago. With the upcoming law that prohibits the use of cell phones without hands-free devices, I needed a 2nd headset for our 2nd car. I figured I could leave a headset in each car and both my wife and I would always have a headset to use regardless of driver or car. I found out that my old headset does not support multiple pairings (Multipoint) and neither does the Samsung WEP410.  At the incredible after rebate price however, I was willing to give it a shot anyways.FITThis has to be the most important aspect of the headset, in my opinion. My old Logitech headset fit great, but did take some time to get used to.  Because the earpiece actually goes inside the ear, it is easy to put on and take off with one hand.  It's not quite comfortable enough for me to just leave it in there all day.  I've not tried using the other ear gels to see if they may be more comfortable than the one that was already on the headset out of the box.CALL QUALITYI can hear very well while in the car and so far nobody has asked me to repeat myself.  They have said that they could not tell I was using a headset.BATTERY & CHARGINGThe WEP410 comes with a handy plastic carrying case that doubles as a charger.  It took less than 2 hours to completely charge, which is half the time it takes for me to charge my Logitech headset. The battery life of about 4 hours talk-time is more than enough for my limited use and I have yet to recharge it in the 3 weeks I've been using it.  Be careful with the case however.  If you lose it, you will not be able to charge your headset.BUTTONSThere are only 3 buttons on this tiny headset.  The main multi-function button is a good size and the two volume buttons are very small.  The volume buttons are pretty difficult to press at first but after some use, you'll get the hang of it.  I was also dumbfounded as to why the volume UP button would be on the bottom of the headset rather than the top until I realized it is because I wear the headset on my right ear.  If I put it in my left ear, the UP button would indeed be on the top.  The multi-function button allows you to pair your headset, answer/end calls, redial, and activate voice-dialing.  Samsung unfortunately, decided to make the redial function activate with a single touch to the button.  Every headset I've ever used made the single touch be voice-dialing.  The problem here is that you will accidentally call the last person you spoke with on numerous occasions.  Even when I try to end the call, if the person ended the call before me, and I push the button to end, it will redial them.  I've done this several times already.  Samsung was not using their heads on this at all.  To activate voice-dialing, you must press the button and hold it until you hear a beep.INSTRUCTIONSThe manual is easy to read and clear.  It's more thorough than some I've read.SUMMARYThere were hardly any reviews for this headset when I purchased it and I only bought it because of how inexpensive it was.  After a couple of weeks of use, I bought one for my wife and now both my sister-in-laws have one too.  They have the same complaints about the redial button, but are happy with the headset regardless.  I would not recommend this headset at full price, but the after rebate price makes this good, not perfect headset, worthy of trying.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tremendous value after rebate, but with caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1212883200, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2008"},

So i won't go into that more than to say its no lie its as good as advertised. and the incoming sound is great as well. at first i did'nt like it. it sounded a little tinny but i found that that was their voice with all the unnecessary frequencies elimated. they are much easier to understand. It kinda sounds like the incoming sound you hear when people talk on aircraft radios.The real enjoyment for me with this headset is the design and materials. first the ear loop is metal with a rubber cover which is great cause you can bend it for a perfect fit. I guess i have weird ears cause most of the headsets ive tried just dont fit. But with the jawbone i can just bend away without taking a hair dryer to it to melt the plastic to bend it. And second most of these in ear headsets require a snug fit in the ear canal. But who among us really finds that comfortable? maybe its just me but it really burns after a while. With the jawbone as long as the ear bud is near the ear canal you can hear it just fine, and it still doesn't wiggle off your ear because of the ability to mold the ear loop to fit. so all in all i have to give it a 5, cause as bluetooth headsets go its about the best your gonna get", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pretty darn good.", "unixReviewTime": 1221696000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2008"},

Volume is controlled by in sections and cycles through in 5 presses.The good: Noise cancelation makes this worth the extra money. It can be charged from USB or power with the included adapter. It is compatible with just about all phones and works well with most devices though it does tend to force a connection with some phones when it should not (causes reboots from time to time on some PDAs).  This is difficult to notice unless you are really looking for it.The bad: As good as the noise cancelation is it does not resolve direct wind noise or a screaming kid in the car, some things can just not be overcome. No headset has solved this problem yet. The ear pieces are cheap and break from time to time when trying to bend or store them, but there are 6 of them. This does not transport very well because of the size and I worry about it in my pocket unprotected. I ripped the back button off while removing the charger once, but Aliph replaced it for free quickly while under warranty in the first year. Some phones (cheap low end phones) have echo problems with the noise cancelation.TIP: It is hard to hear sometimes in loud areas, but I have removed their earpiece and put a jabra ear gel on the speaker to resolve the volume issues to seal it in your ear. This addition completes this headset.Works great in loud ambient noise areas, with the ear gel for you too. Design is neat and functional, but not extremely durable.

Believe me, I've gone through quite a few Bluetooth headsets in the last couple of years, and so I have quite a few to compare this one to.First off, the design of it looks a bit off-putting.  It uses military-grade noise reduction technology and the look of the headset makes me believe that this particular headset may have been originally intended for such use.  It's not exactly the most attractive headset out there - definitely not the most feminine.But to be completely honest with you, after trying a number of `prettier' headsets that either break easily, lose their pairing with the phone frequently, or just plain don't work as well I am all for sacrificing form for function.All that said, while it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing Bluetooth headset, it is not the ugliest either.  It is interesting to note the design differences in the newer Jawbone model that Aliph just released, however.  They've presented a much more attractive version with a sleeker, less obtrusive style, seemingly proving that the manufacturer recognizes the customer's desire, frivolous though we may be, for a headset that is pleasing to the eye.Now for the important part:  how it works.  The Jawbone was simple to pair with my cell phone (HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)), as most Bluetooth headsets are.  More importantly, I've paired it once and it has maintained that pairing without issue ever since, unlike the previous headset I owned which lost its pairing at least once a week, usually while mid-conversation.  This is annoying, certainly, but for a user that won't use their cell phone while driving without a hands-free device, this is very unsettling.  If I wanted/needed to continue a call while on the road, I disconnected the call, pulled over to re-pair the two devices, and then started my call and my trip again.  This is a major issue for me, so I am extremely appreciative of Jawbone's reliability.Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.I've purposely stress-tested it in some pretty noisy situations.  First of all, my own vehicle.  I have an older car, and it seems to pick up all of the outside noise there is, even with my windows up.  If it is raining, my callers could hear the rain on the windshield when using other headsets.  When a semi drove alongside my car, the noise of the big truck distracted my callers from our conversation.Aliph's Jawbone headset changed all that.  My friends and family no longer even suspect I'm in the car when I use it.  If they call me while I'm in a grocery store or department store, they hear neither the hubbub of the store nor the announcements over the building intercom.  Then I went to my favorite wing restaurant, which keeps the music pretty loud.  I stood directly under one of their speakers and asked my friend if she could hear it.  She thought she heard some people speaking faintly in the background.  She had no idea I was standing under a speaker with music blaring at me.As for the fit of the headset, it is very secure on my ear.  Like most others, it hooks over the ear, which makes it fit a bit oddly with sunglasses or eyeglasses, but it isn't uncomfortable.  When I get a new headset/earpiece, one of the first things I do is to put it on and shake my head around a bit to test how securely it fits my ear.  This one didn't budge.  For me, this is a very important factor.  If I can't move my head naturally as needed while driving, then the headset impedes my ability to drive and I won't have that.Some of you probably want to know about how it charges.  I use mine quite a bit for both personal and business, and it isn't rare for me to wear out the charge before the day is out.  I've only managed to drain my Jawbone twice, and it charges so quickly that I was able to use it again within an hour or so.  It comes with a cable that can charge through an electrical outlet or a USB port on a PC.  It does not have a car charger, but since I have a power inverter for my car, I can simply use it to charge it while driving should the need arise, so this isn't a deal breaker for me.All in all, I highly recommend the Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset.  When I finally break or lose this one, I will look at replacing it with another Aliph model before any other manufacturer.Most recent Headsets I've used:Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset - BlackJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged]Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth HeadsetMotorola H300 Bluetooth Headset", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable Bluetooth headset with fantastic noise reduction capabilities!", "unixReviewTime": 1211328000, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2008"},

I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection.Someone on  quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment.The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear.Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it.The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break.There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call.The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be.Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen.Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection.I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics.The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable.Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support.

I'm happy to report that I experienced neither of these problems.  The headset fits perfectly around my ear, it doesn't slip even when I'm moving, and I'm barely aware that it's there.  Also, the charger fits snugly into the socket and I haven't had any trouble with loose connections.Sound quality seems to be great, the people I talked to say they can hear me fine even in loud environments.  As mentioned in other reviews, this headset does not cancel wind noise, probably because wind noise is highly variable.  So, don't expect to use this on a gusty day or while riding in a convertible.My BIGGEST COMPLAINT with this product is the clunky charger.  Why does every electronics company insist on introducing their own charger socket standard when there is a perfectly fine standard (Mini USB) already out there?  Motorola phones, BlackBerries, most PDAs and many other headsets all use this standard charging socket.  This means I don't need to lug around an extra charger, as I can charge my phone and headset off the same charger.  Unfortunately, the Jawbone charger is completely nonstandard... I can't even get an iGo power tip for it.  Finally, the charger itself is poorly designed.  It's another \"huge brick\" that takes up two power sockets.  The rubber cover that covers the socket on the headset when you're not charging removes completely and I'm sure I will lose it within a month.  You'd think that a company that could design such a cool headset would put a little more thought into the charger.However, you buy a headset to talk clearly and on that point this one delivers.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Sound Quality, But...", "unixReviewTime": 1184284800, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2007"},

I purchased the JB2 because I liked the JB1 so much.The JB2 syncs right out of the box provided that you remember to hold the power button on for 7 seconds or so from the off position to sync it for the first time. After that its pretty self explanatory.The original JB1 had a nice sound to it. The new JB2 sounds like cheap car speakers that are turned up too loud. It distorts sound easily at higher volumes. It is very lightweight and relatively comfortable. Let's face it - human ears come in different shapes and sizes. Hopefully yours will be the same shape and size as one of the three ear buds provided with the new JB. They eliminated the old tear drop shape earbud from the new model which is disappointing since I found that one to be the most comfortable fit. You will find that none of your old JB1 accessories will work with the JB2. This includes the earbuds and loops.I would have liked to see them improve on what they started with rather than make a lighter one that sounds worse. If I knew now what I knew then I would not make the leap for the new one just yet. I feel like whatever improvments were made, were quickly lost in sound quality. For $60 you can still get a 1st generation that sounds better.The JB2 has lots of room for improvement. If the sound quality were brought up to par with the JB1, and it included the teardrop earbud I'd give it 5 stars. In summary its about prioritization. If sound quality is your top priority, get the JB1 and save some cash. If comfort is more important to you than great sound, you may really like the JB2.

Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear.

They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website.

My calls could all hear the background noise when noise reduction was enabled (the default state), but disabling it caused the noise they heard to be so great they couldn't understand me. I can't say that noise reduction was 100%, but it was pretty darned good.FIT:I was a little uncomfortable with the fit at first - it seemed too loose to me. The unit comes with several ear loops and ear buds, and I tried them all before settling on the loop and bud that came installed out of the box. As I've grown accustomed to the unit, though, the 'looseness' no longer bothers me, and I find I can wear it the entire day without discomfort. In noisy environments I find I have to press the earbud deeper into my ear to drown out ambient noise. This hasn't been a huge inconvenience, because I don't spend that much time in high-noise environments, but I could see it being a major annoyance if I did.APPEARANCE:I've seen plenty of grey and black Jawbones (even one that was painted with shimmery pink nail polish), but have never seen another red one like mine. I get a lot of positive comments on both color and appearance.I really like the appearance of the unit. It's distinctive; clean lines, no visible buttons. It just LOOKS easy to use.BLUETOOTH:I've used several Bluetooth headsets, with varying degrees of ease in pairing the unit to my phone. This one was one of the easiest and quickest setups I've done. My phone is a Blackjack II, using Windows Mobile 6.PRICE:I've wanted a Jawbone for some time now, but wasn't willing to purchase one until the price fell under $80. Of course, that was only because Jawbone II was recently released. I don't know that I'd invest in a full-priced Jawbone or Jawbone II, but it was definately worth what I paid for mine.I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great!

I finally tried the Jawbone and it is a keeper.The Jawbone has excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. The person on the other end thought I was on a landline phone. On my end the caller comes in loud and clear. I even turned on a vacuum cleaner and stood next to it and the other person did not hear it at all. You can adjust the volume, but I let the headset do that. Somehow it senses the noise level around you and adjusts the volume accordingly for both you and the person you are calling.This headset is larger than it appears in pictures. It is also a little heavier then some others I have tried. The only downside is that it is very difficult to put on. I suppose I will figure it out with some practice. It is not quite as comfortable as some others I have tried, but I am getting use to it. After having it on for a while I did not even notice it was on my ear.It comes with 4 ear hooks, which is 2 for left and 2 for right ear. That sounds odd, but the hooks are slightly bent to fit either right or left ear. The reason is because it is spring loaded to gently force the speaking sensor next to your face. The hooks are 2 different sizes and the wire can be bent to better fit your ear. After doing some adjustments the headset fits snuggly and does not flop around. It also comes with 4 different shaped ear buds. The charger is unusual. The cable that plugs into the wall charger is USB, so you can use the same cable to charge the Jawbone on your PC.As with most headsets you have to get use to putting it on and adjusting it where it fits comfortably and correctly to get the best sound. The minor negatives do not mean much compared to features and sound quality. That is why I give it 5 stars.Update: I have read several reviews complaining that they just could not get the Jawbone to fit or the ear bud to stay in their ear. Here is what I did. I first gently bent the ear loop to more of a closed position to fit tighter around my ear. Then, as you know, the loop is already bent to force the ear bud more into your ear and the speaker closer to your face. I took that shape and bent it a little farther. Now, the ear bud fits farther into my ear and the headset feels more comfortable and does not flop around. Obviously if you bend it too far it will break. So, be careful. This adjustment worked for me. I also took the advice of another reviewer about how to put the headset on. This is, basically, what he said. Put your thumb over the ear bud. Hold the headset horizontally and flat against your head then start sliding the end of the loop over the top of your ear. Then as you slide it on, rotate it at the same time to the correct position. It really works and now I can get it on with one hand in 2 seconds.Another update: Even though the noise cancellation really works, it also breaks up your voice and the callers voice. I suggest you only use the noise cancellation when you need it. Since the noise cancellation is set to be on by default when you turn the headset on, you have to turn it off yourself.UPDATE: It has only been a couple of months since I wrote the above review. The plastic end of the Jawbone that the charger plugs into just broke and is stuck in the charger. I noticed the black plastic end piece was held on by two very tiny plastic hooks and one of them broke. If this is any example of build quality, then I can now only give this headset 2 stars overall.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better quality that most other headsets - UDATE at end of review", "unixReviewTime": 1197590400, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2007"},

Previous Motorola and Jabra headsets were harder to use, less durable (fell apart) and did not fit my small ears very well. The sound quality is great and when I first got this, I took it on a trip and used it to make conference calls from my hotel room, answer calls on the street and in the car. It is the best Bluetooth headset that I have purchased, as it was easy to pair, sound quality is great and the battery life holds up as promised.1. If you can, it is better to try on or look at a headset in real life before buying it on Amazon. All of these headsets fit differently. Or else you return it if it does not work well for you. (I did not buy this from Amazon for myself due to fit but I bought it as a present for my brother from Amazon).2. Less fancy buttons, the better it is as you can learn to use it easily and there are less moving parts to break.3. None of the Bluetooth headsets are outstanding as they are very small, so do not assume that it is supposed to do everything and anything.4. If a Bluetooth headset does not work well for you and you can not return it at a later time, pass it on to a friend who can use it.I purchased the Jawbone at full retail at an AT&T; store (and they will replace it if it falls apart and you still have the receipt)as I could not find a headset with the right fit without trying it on (they have sample headsets that you can try) and I was leaving on a business trip shortly. However, as I noted, I bought this at Amazon for my brother and he LOVES it (had a Motorola and Jabra before). He wears it every day when he walks to work and in the car when he is driving.I don't use my headset except when I travel now as I have a car with Bluetooth and my phone automatically pairs to the car audio.

I did quite a bit of research before buying. I tend to be pretty skeptical of Bluetooth headsets. I currently own about 6 of them. Two different models of Plantronics, 2 models of Jabra, and 2 models of Motorola. This particular headset was of interest to me because I have a loud car (corvette) and none of my other headsets do an adequate job of cutting out the road and engine noise.I have only had the headset for a day however, I am impressed. I tried the Jawbone today in the Corvette and it works great. My wife didn't hear anything but me while I was driving, which is pretty amazing considering how loud the car is. I currently have the Blackberry 8830 and it works great with this headset. The voice dialing pops right up on queue, unlike some of the other headsets I have.So far the only negative is the fit which has been mentioned before. I prefer the in ear variation on the set versus over the ear. (The Jawbone can be used without the ear hook) The fit is not exactly tight but it does seem to work without falling out. I think it will just take some getting used to and playing with the other interchangeable ear adapters.From a sound level standpoint the unit is great. It is down right loud and I can hear the person on the other end with no problem even with my stereo partly on.Overall, I am impressed and happy with my purchase.Update 6/9/07Fit - After playing around with the different ear ear pieces and hooks, I finally have found a combination that works. I have to use a ear hook, which isn't my favorite but after you get used to it, it isn't too bad. Also, it fits much more securely with the hook and is more comfortable.Additionally I have spoken with a number of others via the headset and towards the end of the conversation I ask them how I sound and they all have said great.Update 6/14/07Well this one is a keeper. Now that it has been a few days I have gotten used to using the headset with the ear hook and it works great. Takes some getting used to and practice to put in on one handed but once you do, it's pretty easy. Call quality continues to be excellent. If I could rate it higher than a 5 I would. By far the best headset I have used.Update 11/2/07Still using the Jawbone.  Very happy with it.

Glue it together if you really like it.Motorola L6- stock verizon unit- overpriced.Pros:I walk across a campus and between buildings, exposed to the elements for a few minutes of the day.  None of these headsets can handle minor wind noise, not even a slight breeze.  The Jawbone is only slightly better with wind but it is hardly worth noting.The Jawbone noise reduction works in many situations that all others do not.I have verified the in-car with stereo playing test- windows down (but don't get the device in the wind).  The server room- I turned off the noise reduction, the other party did not even know I was in the server room until I turned off the noise cancellation.At my local noisy echoing jazzy starbucks- the other headsets were useless and I would have to go outside.  The jawbone allows me to speak in a normal voice despite being in a loud environment.Looks very cool- always getting complements.Others I have convinced to purchase the jawbone like the selection of clips and earpieces, the noise reduction really works.Cons:Ear clip material- I think it's metal- it will break after being bent a few times (my first one lasted four months), it's not like wire in that it does not \"feel\" like it's supposed to be bent to fit to your ear.Ear \"plug\" does not fit well enough, should be made of that sticky rubber stuff like jabra and plantronics.  I'm going to try one of the jabra earpieces as others have suggested.Apparently wind noise is very difficult to cancel- it makes me want to put a foam or fabric wind screen on it- that's the only problem I have with the sound.I wear it often, it holds itself under tension on my ear.  When I take it off it still feels like it's there for a while.  I often forget I have it on too, and end up in family photos wearing it.It occasionally goes through a connection losing spat- it must be powered off for a few minutes when it does this.  It happens every few weeks and is SUPER ANNOYING. I have read other reviews that voice this issue.  The benefits outweigh the annoyance for me.  It would be a five were it not for the disconnect issue.The \"ringing music\" sound, connection and power off sounds are all pure tones.  They sound primative, like atari 2600.  Slightly grating, considering how loud they can be relative to the environment.  I'm guessing all the development costs went into noise cancellation and styling... nothing was spent on the audible status/ring sounds- or someone likes atari 2600.This is the official \"brittany spears\" headset.

It's a bit long and wearing it on your hip vertically makes it uncomfortable and unwieldy when you sit down. Whereas a vertical case eliminated this problem. In terms of looks, I feel horizontal and vertical both look equally as cool but a horizontal case is a lot more convenient, at least to me.This DLO case is nicely made and seems durable but unfortunetly, there is a flaw in the design: the exposed open parts can make your iPhone very vunerable to scratches. I noticed a fairly deep scratch on the back of my iPhone right where the middle opening on this case is. It could have happened from a zipper, metal button or most probably from a rivet on my jeans coming in contact with the back of the iPhone through the slot. I am switching to another case that covers more of the iPhone.Just a side note about rubber iPhone cases: I don't like the feel of the rubber cases at all-they feel weird in the hand. And the rubber cases tend to stretch out over time and this lets in dust and grit which can scratch the iPhone. Also Apple recommends you not charge the iPhone will in a rubber case because the heat will not be able to dissipate. This means you have to keep taking it out of the rubber case and putting it back in every time you charge.

This, my Droid, and theCar Dockmake a very happy trio for navigation in my car.However, there are a few minor concerns I'd like to point out: First, the blue LED. Not only does the end of the charger seem to only take up space and shamelessly promote Motorola, the blue LED creates a bit of a distraction, at least where my cigarette lighter is in my vehicle. I'm thinking of taking it apart and removing the LED, but I don't travel at night too much with it so I might let it slide. Second, I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't actually charge the phone, just keep it powered - but to be fair, this is probably either my Droid or the car, not the fault of the charger itself.I haven't had a chance to try charging any other MicroUSB devices with my charger, but I can only assume it works swimmingly.

The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It's a MICRO USB car charger, made for Motorola and sold under the Motorola name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 4.75-5.25V and 950mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it's connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 950mA is provided, they'll still charge, just a bit more slowly.Note that the amperage (second number) merely tells you how much the charger CAN supply, if requested. The phone itself is responsible for asking for the current. That is to say, if this charger can provide 950mA, but your phone can only use 300mA--no problem. Your phone asks for 300mA and the charger provides all of what is requested. If, on the other hand, your phone can use 1000mA, this charger will provide all it can, which is 950mA--a wee bit less than the max asked for. That's also not a problem; it just means your phone will charge a little bit (not much in this case) more slowly. The rated voltage for this charger is presented in a range of 4.75-5.25V. The \"ideal\" voltage for a USB charger of any type if 5V. And most chargers for home use are rated right at 5V. But car chargers work in a noisier environment and thus you have the range. This is where a cheapo charger can really do damage, as some of them are poorly regulated and can provide voltages that are WAY out of spec. Again, when you can get a name brand charger from a seller you can trust (Amazon) for such a reasonable price, it's very foolish to consider the cheapo no-names.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers. What's not to like?BE SURE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS, as some of those have been known to make mistakes with respect to what they ship relative to the listing. I can confirm that Amazon is shipping the P513 /89143N charger, as pictured.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Genuine Motorola charger in retail packaging. 4.75-5.25V 950mA output, works w/ most micro-USB phones like Incredible, etc.", "unixReviewTime": 1276214400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2010"},

The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don't know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer's video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn't have Motorola logo, just a \"check mark\" graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola \"M\" clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I've been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone's battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon's usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping. Until Amazon cracks down on sellers' misleading listings, you are really walking into the lion's den slathered with A-1 sauce when you take a chance on a third party seller, just to save a few dollars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pretty sure it's geniune, and it does charge faster -- read further to find out why", "unixReviewTime": 1333843200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2012"},

Rather than spend the $30 Verizon wants for their branded chargers, I ordered this charger for under $6. It appears to be of pretty high quality and charges my Motorola Barrage and my wife's Motorola Droid with no problems. There are only two negatives. The body of the unit is fairly long and bulky, sticking much farther out of the dash than the Verizon charger. Also, the futuristic-looking blue illuminated Motorola logo is huge, and at night it is so bright it can be a little distracting. I have found that if I turn the charger 90 degrees to either side, I can no longer see the huge gleaming logo.UPDATE: I just ordered another of these chargers which are of impressive quality for the money. The first one lasted nearly three years and just recently stopped charging my phones. In addition to the phones mentioned above, it has also worked well with our Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX and our Blackberry Bold.

Howell", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I own a Samsung Infuse smartphone and like many other smart phones you cannot use it in the car for GPS purposes without draining the battery.  Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.  So long as I am not doing anything intensive with the phone in the car, it charges my phone very rapidly with no problems what so ever.

I've gone through a couple of off-brand chargers that seemed to break after a year of use that cost a few bucks more than this one.  If you are looking for a good charger for your Motorola-branded phone or anything else that charges via a micro-usb like my Kindle Fire, I would recommend this one.3/18/14 Update:The above review was written after using the charger for about two weeks.  After a longer period of time, while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid, the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and, for example, when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive, it consistently never gets above 50% charged.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Well-Constructed Charger But Not Much Power", "unixReviewTime": 1390867200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2014"},

After being pleased with the first one, I tried to purchase 2 more, but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper, and I worry that it won't be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger, the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning, with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90%, I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out, and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless, I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6, it's a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets, I also have recently tried the \"Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp)\" and was pretty pleased with it. I didn't try it with tablets, but it performed the same test as above with the same results (if not better), and so I'm pretty confident it really will deliver the 3.1A it promises if necessary (and certainly the 2.1A needed for a single tablet plugged in).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice charger.

I'm on the road a lot, and the \"max\" setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus.

The Blueant Z9 is extremely lightweight and small. This makes it very comfortable, feels secure and does not flop around. The sound is loud enough that you do not have to increase the volume. The voice quality is clear and consistent. I have it paired with a Nokia 6555.Now for some details. The Jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation. However, the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup. The Z9 does a good job on noise cancellation and the voice stays clear and does not breakup.There are three buttons. The function button handles most features. There are two volume buttons for up and down. The volume buttons also have functions such as holding down the volume up button for three seconds actives the redial feature. This may sound confusing, but it really is not. You just need to read the instructions. The buttons are easy to press with little resistance.The Z9 has a large speaker so there was no need in the design for an ear bud that directs the sound into the ear. It also has two microphones that help improve voice quality for the person you are talking too.The noise cancellation defaults at minimum. In noisy environments, simply click the function button. A voice tells you that it is set to maximum noise cancellation. That is really a cool feature because you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean.The range is as advertised. I walked away from my phone by about thirty feet and still had a clear connection. Therefore, you do not have to place the headset on the same side or close to your phone.I looked at my phones paired devices and noticed I had firmware version 3.1. I went to the Blueant site and downloaded the instructions and installation program for firmware version 3.4. I could not get the installation to work, so I called tech support. He told me that the instructions online were for Windows XP and I had Vista. He said that they have not posted the instructions for Vista online yet. He promptly emailed me the Vista instructions. They were detailed and precise. I upgraded the firmware within a few minutes without any problem.Helpful hint: To get the best sound qualities, speak in a normal voice, not too loud. In addition, update the firmware to the latest version.I highly recommend you try this headset for yourself.Update: I have read that the ear hook is made of stiff plastic that cannot be bent. This is not entirely true. If you want a tighter and more secure fit then do the following. While holding the hook in the bent position you want, hold a hot hairdryer about two inches from it for about five seconds. The hook will stay in that bent position. Just be careful not to bend it too far or the hairdryer is too hot or too close to the hook.

Yes, it is a little confusing to know when to \"click\" a button and when to \"hold\" a button for 3 seconds and which combinations you need to press, but for the basic functions it's pretty straightforward and only for fancier things do you need to memorize (or look up in the handy guide) the buttons to press.What about background noise?

It is better than all the others I tried, both in fit and sound quality.If you have a high need for switching between multiple devices, however, be aware that the advertised \"on the fly switching\" between up to 3 devices does not really work very well.The major shortcoming is that you have to completely turn off the current device (or its bluetooth radio) before you can switch to another device.  This makes no sense at all, since the Z9 has a button control for disconnecting from current device.Depending on your setup, this can range from a nuisance to a major roadblock.  For example, my setup is to use the Z9 with my laptop for Skype calls and my Blackberry for other calls.  I may switch back and forth regularly, depending on who I am calling.If I want to switch from cell phone to laptop, I have to complete turn off the cell phone bluetooth radio, which means the Blackberry loses all of its blutooth connections (including bluetooth synching to PC and modem use).  If I want to switch from laptop to Blackberry, I have to either turn off my entire laptop (it doesn't have a bluetooth radio off option), or remove the Z9 device from the bluetooth profile completely, which means I have to reinstall it from scratch again the next time.There is a new version called the Z9i, which claims to have better/more options for multiple devices.

I have not found a single one my my rechargable electronics for which there is no callpod adapter. I felt that the default adapter's included with the callpod were not the best choice. So before purchasing a callpod make sure you count the cost of all of the spokes that you will purchase; they usually will cost you between seven and ten bucks apiece. But for me that is worth it. So this version of the callpod allowing you to purchase just the base and then purchase adapter's separately is the best route to go in my opinion.My life is a tangle of cords and the callpod chargepod works to fix that. I keep my six devices (usually two blackberries, an ipod, two bluetooth headsets, and an Amazon Kindle) charging in a self-contained circle without cords going everywhere and without the use of a powerstrip. Then when I travel, I can connect those same device to the car charger using the car power adapter.

Charme", "helpful": [39, 41], "reviewText": "My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise, so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews, but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact, these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to, but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors, including very windy days. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this headset. It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod, (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established), (3) select the first song, and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap, and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor, you should keep some things in mind.First, in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod, either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case, which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want), but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out, and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle, and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third, since the headphones are curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headphones, which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth, because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging, there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time, as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets, but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution, albeit not a perfect one, this is it.Update Nov. 10, 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However, I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day, the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall, and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be \"zapped\" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem, I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent bluetooth headset for ipod", "unixReviewTime": 1196812800, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2007"},

I bought it primarily to listen to music on my mobile phone without wires. The sound quality is great here with good bass.Pairing was simple. Just press the control button on the Cardo S-2 for about 7 seconds till you get alternating red and blue flashing lights and then go to your cell phone and \"add\" a \"new bluetooth device\" (make sure its in \"discoverable\" mode) with the 4 digit, 0000 passcode. Since my Nokia also supports the AVRCP profile, I'm able to control all the functions of the music player through pressing different parts of the Cardo S-2 headset. Moreover, the headset is very comfortable to wear, which is quite important.To get the stereo headset to work, I first press the control button on the S-2 for about 3 seconds till I see blue flashing lights. Then I go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone and connect it to the Cardo S-2. Now I can open the music player and listen to beautiful music.This headset comes with a hidden microphone. I've used it for voice conversations with my Nokia and it performs quite well. What's most impressive is that it easily switches from stereo to regular voice calling  seamlessly. I hear everyone well and they hear me well too.I paired the Cardo S-2 with my Fujitsu laptop, running XP Professional SP1, with the Widcomm software, version 4.1 and couldn't get it to work with Realplayer or Windows Media Player at all. I then tried version 5.1, but the result was not much better:  just a few sporadic sounds came out. However, when I paired it with the BlueSoleil software version 1.64, I got these headphones to work on my laptop. The music quality was good (but not as good as on my Nokia), but there were breaks once in a while in the music, which I never had with my Nokia 6300b. However, when I tried the software version 3.2 (Bluesoleil), the sound quality of the music was perfect with no gaps. The only remaining problem I had was that MSN Messenger and Yahoo Instant Messenger did not recognize the microphone on my Cardo S-2 (like my Nokia does). When I emailed Cardo's tech support and told them about this problem, I got this abstract robotic response blaming Microsoft's drivers. But I remedied that by buying the tiny $5 Labtec Mic 333 and plugging it into the microphone jack of my laptop's sound card.I bought the Cardo S2 to use primarily with my Nokia so I am very happy with it. With my Nokia 6300b, the Cardo S-2 deserves 5 stars.

I just pop the SIM card into my Quad-Band phone and I'm all set!- The card was free with purchase of mySony Ericsson W580i Grey Phone (Unlocked).Cons:- None that I can think of.Helpful tips:- The phone number you are assigned is from the UK. It will start with county code 44. If people are going to call you from the US, they need to dial 011 44 and then the unique number Mobal assigns you.- Mobal provides a SIM PIN if you wish to lock you phone. It's not required, but it will prevent unwanted use if you happen to lose your phone.- The worldwide emergency number is 112. Works just like 911 in the states.- You have to go to special SIM activations site (Amazon wont let me post the actual URL) to activate the SIM card.

Mobal has absolutely _wonderful_ customer service.  Our initial research had shown that we'd be in places without GSM coverage.  Our friends with a UK phone proved us otherwise -- who knew out back in the Masai Mara a GSM phone would work?  The peace of mind was great, though.Now, when this Mobal SIM card was offered up for free with my N95 purchase, I jumped on it.  How could I pass up a free phone number, free incoming SMS virtually everywhere, and a card that doesn't charge any fees at all?  With this SIM card around, I don't have to think about it.  I can just pop it in and go.  No need to learn a new number, no need to find out what SIM card actually has good rates, etc.Compare this to a buddy who picked up a SIM card to be in France for a month.  The card itself was cheap (maybe $20 -- although that's $10 more than this one).  However, the fine print and extra fees ended up making the whole ordeal cost about $1500 for just a couple of hours of use.  This car in France? Only $150 to call back to the US - and no fussing around. If you'd just roamed with AT&T;: $155 plus fees. And back at the Masai Mara for two hours? AT&T;: $478 Mobal: $234.  No guarantees that a local prepaid SIM wouldn't charge huge rates for international calling, either.If that still sounds expensive, just remember that there are no other fees and it's your phone number.  Additionally, remember that you'll not be yacking on the phone like you do back home (you're traveling -- see the sites!)  Even my 2 hour example is excessive for us; we rarely talk more than a couple of minutes when really traveling to get away.This card is highly recommended, especially if you can get it bundled.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A better deal than the rates imply", "unixReviewTime": 1209340800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2008"},

I didn't have to raise the volume very much to hear my music and block the sound of the mower.My experience connecting to the MSI Starkey on my PC was not even near satisfactory.  For some reason I hear the mic even when it should be muted.  This didn't happen with my Plantronics 510 headset.

I listen to that stuff all the time--and now I can do it in any environment. Best of all in this type of application, you can remove the stereo earbud and you have a single-ear bluetooth cellphone headset that can also receive A2DP signals from your phone--the only mono device I'm aware of that can do this.The only time I attach the stereo bud is when I'm mowing my lawn and want the extra sound insulation. I use the triple-flange Etymotic eargels for it. It's a fight to get them attached, but the great sound insulation that results is an absolute wonder. Makes the noise of the mower nearly disappear, and lets me enjoy my favorite talk show at the time of my choosing, while getting actual, noisy work done.If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it, this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head, and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.And when a call comes through, I don't need to jam this thing further into my ear with the call button to answer it. I just extend the little mic boom, and it connects. Others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear. But with the Ety eargel it has a good snug fit that stays secure.My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car, even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials, and over my bluetooth to boot.As you may expect, I charge my 855 when I'm not using it. I've only had it run out of juice once, and that was after a very long session of listening at relatively high volume with the stereo bud in. It charges up fast, and goes for a longer time than it ought to. If you want to listen to podcasts on your mobile, this is the best piece of hardware out there to do just that.I couldn't get any of the included eargels to fit with this device, but with my weird-shaped head, that's no surprise. the Ety plugs are a lifesaver, and you can buy them in bulk from Etymotic so you can have a supply of clean ones. You are, after all, sticking it in your ear.I love this product. It does more than I hoped it would, and enhances my life far beyond its low cost (got mine for $35). If you have an mp3-enabled phone with lots of memory (like a Q or Blackjack with a good-capacity MicroSD card) and you like talk radio, get one of these and prepare for a great experience. You'll find yourself leaving the iPod and headphones at home because they're just too much of a hassle and this stuff works great.Love the functionality this item gives to products and services I already had.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just what I was looking for.", "unixReviewTime": 1211500800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2008"},

It's small, sounds great and the sliding boom mike picks up your voice very well. Sliding the boom open when a call comes in automatically picks up the call, and sliding it close ends the call.The headset also features an action button, mute button and a volume control. Each action is signaled by a corresponding chime.Plantronics switched from their proprietary connector to a standard micro USB (the same as on the Kindle 2). The bundled neckband cleverly features a micro USB plug so you can easily attach the headset when not in use.If you want to use your headset in stereo mode (your device must support stereo bluetooth, of course, like most stereo telephones, iPhone 3.0, etc...) simply attach the earloop accessory and use the second earbud. Note that the stereo device does not have to be the same device as your phone: you could pair the 855 with your phone as a headset, and with your iPod Touch (with 3.0 OS) as BT headphones. If you're listening to music and a call comes in, you will hear the ring. Extend the boom to pick up the call, the music will pause and resume when you close the boom to hang up. How awesome is that?This headset is close to perfect and I found very few flaws with it:- Second earbud is fragile and cumbersome. It would be nice to have a better way to carry it, maybe something that would attach to the neckband.- Previous track/next track control is combined with volume+/volume- button and requires a long press on those keys. Skipping tracks takes 3 seconds, that's way too much.These are extremely minor gripes considering the excellent performance of this great headset and its remarkably low price.

It is a Bluetooth earpiece; it is a set of stereo Bluetooth earbuds.  It is one or the other depending on the ear clip being used.  The earpiece is designed to go into the right ear.  There is a standalone ear clip that allows the earpiece to function as a standalone unit.  The other ear clip is wired to an earbud that goes into the left ear and allows the unit to perform as stereo headphones.  Everything can be take apart and it will all fit into a pouch small enough to comfortably pocket.  The wire between the earpieces is sufficiently long to fit any head comfortably and is cloth covered.  There are multiple sets of earplugs so you can get a good fit to your ear.Either way, you have a decent-sounding (a little thin on the low end, though) headset that is suitable for most any situation.  The mic mini-boom does extend out if you need it closer to your mouth, but the mic is plenty sensitive (almost TOO sensitive as it can pick up a fair bit of ambient noise at times).  All the controls are on the right earpiece.  The only drawback is that the volume rocker pulls double-duty as the track forward/backward selector (you have to hold it down to engage this function, and sometimes I was unsuccessful in doing so).The fact that this is uniquely convertible is quite handy, but it does have a few limitations:- It is not very loud.  It depends on the phone being used with it, and with some phones, you may find yourself plugging your left ear so you can hear the conversation.  Note though, that using the left earpiece will help with this.- The charging port is a MicroUSB, rather than the MiniUSB that is found on most headsets.  There is a charger included, but if you want to use a regular home or car charger, you will have to buy an adapter ($5~8).- When the battery is low, it will beep at you every 10 seconds or so, which gets annoying quickly.- I haven't had problems with the ear clips, but they do not look terribly sturdy.If I could, I'd honestly give the product a 3.5-star rating, but I will round it up to 4 just because this is a handy package to have.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Certainly not perfect, but very handy", "unixReviewTime": 1302134400, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2011"},

It's easy to hook up but you'll need an adapter if your headunit doesn't have free RCA inputs. There's no provision for bridging or adding to an existing RCA input device. The cord provided seems to be long enough but when you actually get to threading it around the dash bits of your car it's not long enough to reach up into the roof lining or sun visors where the mic could adequately pick up your voice. The mic is horrible- the noise suppression basically doesn't work and you'll sound like you're in a tin can regardless of how loud you turn this up. Fortunately, on the output side the unit works well and includes a switch which lets you route signal to your left or right car speakers. It doesn't seem to have a provision to route it to both so you're likely to have to turn up your stereo quite loud to hear the other person.The controls don't work for my android phone or my wifes nor with my daughter's nokia so don't think you'll be able to answer or hang up with the interface on the mic unit. It also doesn't seem to control any digital music players we've tried. The unit only works for one bluetooth device at a time so if it's hooked up to a passenger's phone or computer you won't be able to use it for your phone. Also, it has to be paired whenever you switch bluetooth devices; it doesn't seem to remember units it's paired with previously.The head unit has an incredibly bright blue led that's so obnoxious I've had to face the unit against the headliner to prevent it from being distracting at night. The led will literally light up the inside of your car; it's that bright and blinking. You can't turn it off or change the color- it just blinks and annoys.So, for this rather amazingly high price you get a unit which doesn't work very well at it's basic tasks (picking up speech, playing music or letting you listen to callers) and doesn't have any special features- like multiple pairing, memory or a connection which allows you to have other auxillary devices on your headunit.

Currently it is hooked to a Nokia from T-Mobile.1. It is much lighter and fits much better than the H300.  It seems more secure - the rubber earbud does not block the ear canal (on purpose, for driving - you need to be able to hear around you) but it provides a stabilizing point.  The Motorola system is just to hang on the hook - one point of stability plus gravity. The Jabra has like a two point of stability deal, plus gravity.2. The hook is easy to switch around so that it goes on the left side.3. It fits well even though I have glasses on.4. It supports all the basics: voice dialing (who knew this phone supported that - but it only works, approximately, when things are very quiet. Speaking a short sentence is amusing - it brings up a ton of things), answering hand free, hanging up, and switching a call to and from the earpiece.5. It practices serial monogamy. It can pair with one device at a time, and the same single button that hangs up or answers the phone with a momentary press, and redials with a double tap, and goes into voice dial mode with a 2 second press when you start by being on hook, and switches the call to the handset with a 2 second press when you are off hook, and switches the call from the handset back to the headset with a three second press, and turns the earpiece off with a 4 second press, with an even longer press, goes into discovery mode (for about 120 seconds).  When you read about how many things the single button can do with different length presses, you might begin to wonder, \"will I accidentally turn off the headset trying to voice dial?\"Yes you will - unless you carefully listen for the beep and release the button when you hear the beep. So far, the disconnections have been amusing and have only happened when I was distracted.6. People have said that \"there are only four volume positions\". What the earpiece has is a button that transmits \"volume up\" and \"volume down\" to the phone. It gets back a message that says \"ok\" or \"end of limit\".  My phone has eight volume steps and when I adjust the volume, the adjustment steps appear on a slider on the faceplate. I also suspect that on the phone is where the volume adjustment is happening.  So how many volume steps you have is based on what your phone can do, not on what the headset can do. (I'm a little hard of hearing, in a quiet room, I find that six of eight is about right, in a more noisy area, seven of eight).7. Voice dialing is a joke. It brings up almost random numbers that only rarely even sound like what I said. I think that the failure is in the phone and that this is something that they added to make regulators happy, and that it is tested with five radically different sounding names.

No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical, if there's noise, the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought, and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note, the battery, under constant daily use, should last you approximately 500 charges, or 1.5 years avg.

At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need.

While it looks great and does have a slide out keyboard, this phone has serious issues. I agree with many here, it is slow as Hell. If you needed help or have an emergency, your are out of luck. It takes forever to boot up. Of course, leaving it on drains the battery big time. I had my phone synced to my computer and bought a few apps for it and this slowed it down even further. It got so bad, I had to completely reset the device, wiping out all my info. I stopped syncing it and had to ditch some apps I really liked because the Tilt had issues with them. The Internet looks horrible on this phone, it is slow even with a 3G connection and I don't bother with the Wi-Fi. I won't play music on it. Call quality is also not great. I use a Jabra bluetooth which makes calls sound much better and clearer than the phone itself. The lag time for opening anything is far too long. It takes what seems like an eternity for the Windows Mobile system to open apps up. I had used Motorolas, (hated those), Nokia (loved them) and this was the first HTC phone I have tried. It will be my last. I have an iPod Touch which I love and now want an iPhone. The Touch is easier to use than this. The Tilt is too overpiced for how it (does not) perform. While it has a lot of features, getting to them and using them wastes time that you are supposed to be saving. If I had known then what I know now, I would have never have bought this phone. It only gets 2 stars because of the screen keyboard and Office Mobile apps included. I was extremely disappointed in how this phone operates. If you are thinking of purchasing this phone, DON'T Bother, there are better phones out there.I am going to revise my review to note a few things about how this phone works. After having tried a new Nokia N96 and its annoying menus and buttons, I actually found myself missing some features of the Tilt. The Tilt will allow you to directly access features by both screen touch and stylus. Connections to the Internet may be slow, but it will use the best option available without bugging you. The Internet does not look as good as it does on an iPod Touch or an iPhone. The buttons on the face do light up and are easy to see quickly and the keyboard is helpful. Navigation is better than I orginally thought.  It is not enough to change my rating or suggest purchasing it unless you really want a PDA more than a phone. The Tilt does have strong PDA features, but it does run under the Windows Mobile interface.

{"reviewerID": "A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB", "asin": "B000UWDU5K", "reviewerName": "D. Dell \"Dell\"", "helpful": [45, 46], "reviewText": "I have had two cell phones, but was not happy with either of them. So, for weeks I researched cell phones. I read reviews and even downloaded manuals to see what the various phones would do and not do. I finally decided to try the ATT Tilt.Battery life: Several reviewers complained about short battery life. So, this was my first test. On day one I turned up the brightness and set the backlight to stay on longer. Then I played with it by going to every program and application. I also went to all the settings and played around getting them how I wanted. I also placed a few brief calls. Then I spent a while online using WiFi. I even took a few pictures. I put this phone through its paces for 6 hours and had 17 percent battery life left. The next day I completely drained the battery and recharged it to condition the new battery. Then I put it to work again for another 3 hours or more. I had 40 percent battery life on the second day after a full charge. Of course, if I had been on phone calls most of the time, I am sure that the battery would have only lasted 3 or 4 hours. Therefore, because of my experiences thus far I would rate the battery life as fair when compared to some other smart phones. For power users they do make an extended life battery available online.Camera: Many reviewers also said the 3mg camera does not take very good pictures. This is true. Even though there are some settings to help improve the picture quality, I found that it really did not help much. So, I rate the camera as average to poor.Performance: Again some reviews I read complained about screen refresh rate or lag. I found this does happen sometimes. The lag time can be from 1 to 4 seconds. However, there are ways you can minimize this. As with any computer, the more programs you have running the more memory they use and the slower the response time. Try launching a few programs then tap on the memory icon. There you will see how much storage you have on the main unit and SDcard. You will also see how much memory the programs are using. To help with response time touch the Quick Menu at the top right of the screen and close all open programs that you are not using. Plus, wait a couple of seconds for a program to fully load before you try to navigate within the program. Also, files such as MP3s, photos and documents should be moved to the SDcard to free up space on the device itself.Keyboard: I love the slide out QWERTY keyboard. It is much easier and faster to use than the tiny keys on most other smart phones. Of course, having a large keyboard means you have to use both hands which most users do anyway. I give this feature a very high mark for convenience and usability.Microsoft Mobile: Personally I love this system because it is like my home computer, complete with a Start Menu. I find it familiar and easy to use.Sound quality: Addressing some reviewers concerns about low sound when playing MP3s, this is what I found. There are 2 sound settings. One is for the ring tones and the other for the device itself. Tap the Speaker Icon on the top right and you will see these settings. I turned both of them up all the way and launched the music player. The sound was loud and clear. I set a Blackjack II next to it and found that the Tilt was actually slightly louder.Size: I almost did not get the Tilt because of the weight. Plus, it is a little thicker that most other phones. While in the ATT store I picked up a Blackjack II then a Blackberry then held the Tilt in the other had. The weight of the Tilt was a little more that either of the other two, but not enough to matter to me. Although, this might be an issue for some that want a smaller or lighter cell phone.Voice quality: While on a call I found the sound quality clear and loud. There is a scroll wheel on the upper left side that will adjust volume while on a call which comes in handy. I also handed the Tilt to someone and called it to see how it was from both ends of receiving and placing a call. The quality was better than my cordless landline phone. I rate the call quality as excellent.Helpful hint: When on a call the screen turns off in about 10 seconds. However, you can still use the Talk key to mute the call or End key to disconnect the call. If you want the screen back on, simply press the Power button on the upper right side of the phone. Or, you can use the Scroll wheel, but this will also adjust the volume at the same time. Also, when the screen is off in idle mode none of the keys will turn the screen back on except one. To turn the screen back on from idle either press the Power button or slide out the keyboard.Word and Excel: You can create and edit in these programs without Documents To Go. Then you can either import or export them to your computer or email them. This is a great feature.WiFi: I do not text or get online that much with a cell phone. But, when I do get online then this is the only way to go. Plus, I can save twenty or thirty dollars a month by not getting the data plan. I simply get online at home or in hotspots. I also disabled the Media Net so that I do not accidentally get on line and get charged a fortune for it.Today Screen: The home screen desktop is called the Today Screen on the Tilt. I did not like the looks of this desktop at all. For one thing there is a lot of wasted real estate that could be used. The European version of the Tilt is different. I found a free plug-in that is the same as the other version and installed it. There was no editing the register, you just click on the file then reset and that is it. Now, the Today Screen is fully occupied with great looking icons and shortcuts that you can customize.Navigation: There are a few choices when it comes to navigating. You can use the scroll wheel, the touch screen or the navigation buttons on the front bottom of the phone. I also found that I can use my finger on the touch screen 90 percent of the time and with very good accuracy. I seldom use the stylus.There are a few other features you can discover for yourself. I just strongly suggest that you read the manual and experiment with the different setting to see what all it will do. I have not seen a cell phone yet that was perfect, and the Tilt is no exception. However, if you are aware of the quarks from the start then you simply learn how to work around them. Therefore, if you want a cell phone that does it all then this is a device to consider.UPDATE: I only had my Tilt for a few days and it kept locking up when in standby. It would not turn back on by pushing reset or the power button. I could only get it working again by taking out the battery then replacing it. The phone would lock up about every 2 or 3 days. So, I took it back and got a brand new one and it did the same thing. I returned it for a refund because I have no use for a cell phone I can not depend on. Therefore, I can only say that my 5 star rating was for everything I listed above, and I stand by it. However, I have to give it 1 star for reliability.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "All In One Cell Phone.

Emerson", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewText": "I purchased this phone when it was first introduced to the market, about 3 months ago or so, and thus far, I've enjoyed the experience, and am thoroughly pleased with what I've gotten. I go into more detail below in list form, but for a brief summation, I'll just say that this is an excellent communication phone, with great quality voice calls, excellent download and browsing speeds, and good email and messaging capabilities. GPS is very well integrated, and the Windows Mobile platform is incredibly convenient. The keyboard and screen are also very user-friendly. Doesn't really have an impressive media arsenal, so if you're looking for an entertainment phone, with a focus on music and video, look into an Apple iPhone. Otherwise, great for organization, picture and file sharing, and staying in touch, world-wide or locally. I very much recommend this phone.The PROs:The Windows Mobile 6 platform. Syncs very well with my PC, is easy to set up, and user-friendly, once you get the logistics of the programs down. The extra memory allows programs to run very quickly and easily, and the Today screen and displays are convenient, and functional. (You can also add memory through a MicroSD card, located at the bottom of the phone. Mine's a 4G and works more than adequately.) The contact list and calendar both work off the Outlook base, which I've found convenient and very concise, not to mention very flexible in terms of personal preferences. The best part is the Windows Mobile, which allows you to edit, and transfer documents in Excel, Word, and Powerpoint from your PC to your phone very easily, just by dragging and dropping while hooked up to your desktop or laptop, as you would with any external drive. For the student on the go who ends up studying while at work, or editing a paper due the next day, I've found this beyond helpful, and really, really convenient.The keyboard is roomy, with larger keys that are raised slightly, don't stick or slip, and set-up with function keys that are simple and easy to get used to. Very nice for texting, emailing, document editing, etc., especially with the back-lighting. One thing that I am rather pleased with is the array of keys, keyboard and front, and their usefulness when it comes to short-cuts. The fixed mail and Internet Explorer keys especially are useful, and I am a fan of having them at the same level as the phone and scroll keys. Once I got the arrangment and functions down, I rarely, if ever, used the stylus.The touchscreen feature is really enjoyable, and works very well without major problems, since the screen functions off light pressure instead of heat sensitivity. The screen itself is beautiful, with bright colors and large size, perfect for web browsing and picture-viewing. The tilting aspect is not, of course, a necessary sort of addition to the AT&T; line, but it's amazing how much more comfortable and secure that position makes you feel while holding it, especially since the back of the phone has an incorporated rubber-like material, which makes it really easy to grip. (I've also heard a few complaints about the size, that the phone is \"bulky\", but really, I havn't gotten that impression. It's no Blackberry Pearl, but it's not exactly going to rip your pocket, either.)One word: Fast. Especially over the 3G network. Downloads are quick, web-browsing is enjoyable, and calls are fantastic. The clarity over the phone on both ends of the call is always exceptionally clear and loud. Even in remote areas, where the 3G isn't available, this phone picks up EDGE and GPRS very easily, and rolls up or back to the next strongest network automatically. The tethering available for laptop modems is also an extremely convenient aspect, very easy to use, though definitely doesn't replace a high-speed connection by any means. The GPS intergration is also a fantastic option, and works quickly and very accuratly once the satellites are found. I've downloaded Google maps, and it works very well with the phone. There is also TeleNav available for the phone through AT&T; for an extra fee, and there are other programs like TomTom, but with Google and Yahoo Y.20, you've really no need, unless you want vocal instructions to go with the directions.The CONs:This is not a media phone. I repeat, this is not a media phone. You can load it up with music and videos, and it will play nicely through Windows Media, but it's not anything worth crooning about. The speakers are clear, for the most part, though not very loud, and there isn't a headphone jack on the phone. Bluetooth stereo works pretty well in this case, but I have an iPod for my music, so I wasn't too put out by the handicapped music capabilities. The camera is pretty good, 3MP, and takes quality photos, but there is a shutter delay, so action shots are pretty much ruled out. (I got rid of the shutter delay somewhat by downgrading to a high-resolution 2MP setting.) The video quality is also a bit grainy, no matter how fast the streaming speed, which is a bit disappointing, seeing as how that's a major factor for my catching up with shows and newscasts that I miss while working.Windows Mobile 6 is a bit buggy at times. The Internet Explorer will sometimes start up and not load a page, though resetting the page history and temporary files fixes that, or restarting the phone, as well. There's a delay when switching to landscape mode when opening the keyboard, and programs sometimes delay or freeze without apparent reason, though this is pretty rare. I ended up setting mine to permanent landscape mode to get rid of the delay, since I end up using the keyboard and keys more than anything else. I actually prefer the two-handed setting, really. Windows also has a really annoying sort of organizing system when it comes to placing downloaded files in convenient places. (For example, defaulting a downloaded game to the \"Programs\" folder instead of the \"Games and Apps\" folder was just kind of ridiculous.)The IM feature is very slow, and there is always a delay when connecting and sending with the server. I just ended up not using the feature, which wasn't a huge loss. There is also no push email inherent on the phone, and though AT&T; does offer a push set-up, I coudn't get it to work properly on the phone, so I ended up uninstalling the feature. The send/recieve function works more than adequately, though, and with as many email accounts as you need, so unless you're a Blackberry user and used to their integrated push system, I highly doubt that you'll see that as a huge con. The fact that the phone's screen turns off during calls (which isn't a setting that you can change), and then by default prompts for a security password (unless you turn that feature off), is a somewhat annoying, but not a huge problem.Otherwise?  Fantastic phone.  I've yet to find a perfect phone, but this one suits my lifestyle (on-the-go, never at home) perfectly.

Salinger, MSN, FNP, RN AHN-BC", "helpful": [7, 13], "reviewText": "I bought this phone as I decided I finally needed a combo unit so that I could stop carrying both a phone and a palm. I didn't want a blackberry because the programs I need (epocrates - medication, lab tests and diagnosis lists) doesn't work on blackberry. Pretty much the program only works on Palm and MS mobile platforms.  I was initially nervous because of the mixed reviews, but I can say that so far I am exceedingly happy with the Tilt!For a palm user, the set up is different enough that you can become frustrated trying to do things because it doesn't seem very intuitive. However, once I decided to actually read the instructions VIOLA! Everything worked perfectly and easily. SO! Absolutely read the instructions before using it - it may seem intuitive initially, but you will be frustrated by little differences that you can't figure out otherwise. All of my initial difficulties were user error, so if you're having issues I'm going to bet you still haven't read the instructions :o)Like other commentary, I have found that the battery seems to increase in life as the days go by. The first day or two I had to charge it overnight, then after that It would last with a full day of use (both as a phone, browser use, and checking emails) and through the night and into the next day as well. (I've had the phone a week and it still seems to be increasing in battery life...)My only complaints about the unit are:1. The display page keeps flipping to horizontal w/o my telling it to do so. I'm thinking it likely that I'm bumping it somehow with my case since it's a touch screen.(I have the AT&T; Tilt Designio Leather Case, Horizontal Flip Cover which I also ordered off Amazon and I really like...) There is an icon on the \"today\" screen which you can touch to flip it between horizontal and vertical, so I'm pretty sure it's getting bumped somehow. I'd like to remove the icon so the unit stays vertical except when opening to reveal the keyboard, but I haven't figured out how to do that.My palm had the safari browser and I will say I liked that better than the one with this unit. With safari I could see an entire webpage in miniature. With this one, you only see a section of the page and have to scroll across and down both to find what you seek. Other than those issues I absolutely love the phone so far!A few tips on things I found helpful: (esp. for google, gmail, and epocrates users)1. Absolutely get the unlimited data plan! It's great that I can access the web anywhere and not worry about finding a wifi hot spot! You don't really even need wifi with the unlimited data plan.2. If you use gmail, don't bother with the program the unit has for checking email. The google/gmail \"mobile version\" of gmail is far easier to use and it automatically senses you're on a handheld mobile unit and delivers delivers that very easy to use format to your tilt.3. If you use google calendar you will likely need to synch google to outlook, then outlook to the tilt - I haven't seen anything that will do a direct synch between the two. As far as programs to synch google calendar to outlook, I use companionlink's conduit and it works nice and smooth. If you set it up to synch on a schedule each day, then it's no big deal to synch with the tilt and keep everything relatively updated with all relevant info.4. If you use epocrates, the program for the MS mobile platform is great and it automatically updates its-self wirelessly through the phone data link each day - nice and smooth with ever current information at your fingertips. It's also great because you can access the web & email within the hospital setting as needed. (Now that many facilities are limiting access to their intranet only)5. If you get the divisio leather case the clear part goes over the keyboard and the tilt screen slides OVER the plastic. I initially was trying to squeeze the whole thing under the plastic and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.So, my take home message would be:Great phone with great web access and usability.

{"reviewerID": "ARXU3FESTWMJJ", "asin": "B000UWDU5K", "reviewerName": "Mary Jo Sminkey \"15 years of Amazon Reviews!\"", "helpful": [382, 409], "reviewText": "I was lucky enough to hear that this phone had been released just days after I had bought the 8525 to replace a previous broken phone. There seemed to be some confusion with the AT&T; sales people, since currently with rebates it sells for less than the 8525 and some internal memo seems to have them telling customers that a different update to the 8525 is still coming. Make no mistake, this is the upgrade for the 8525 and it's a beauty! Since there's pretty good specs and basic data on what the phone includes on the Amazon product page, I'll just run down some improvements over the 8525:1. New sleek black casing. It's not as slippery so less likely to be dropped!2. When keyboard is out, you can tilt the screen up. This makes it particularly nice for watching videos on a plane or using as an alarm clock, etc.3. GPS built in. You can pay for the AT&T; Telenav...or just load on your own navigation software like TomTom. More on this later...4. Double the memory! One of my biggest issues with windows mobile phones was they had so much less usable memory on the device. I do tend to load a lot of applications and many I really prefer to run on the device, not on an external card. So yeah for this!5. 3 MP camera (up from 2) with autofocus. No light to use as a flash though (not that it was all that great anyway!)6. Dual processor and graphics accelerator for improved performance7. Windows Mobile 6Okay, so those are the improvements in a nutshell. Lets look at this sucker in more detail.First, the package from AT&T; is pretty bare bones. You get the phone, an extra stylus, screen protector, AC charger, USB sync cable, and the usual software CD with ActiveSync and user's manual. That's basically it! There's no case, no headphones, not even a headphone adapter. This device does support stereo bluetooth headphones, so a lot of people will probably get those instead, but to not even include a basic slip case? Pretty cheap for a device in this price range.The device itself is really pleasing to look at. The front is actually considerably darker to the eye than the photos on this page, more like a dark grey than silver, which I think is quite nice looking (see the photo I uploaded). The back does show fingerprints a bit, but it has a nice feel to it and is easy to gripe. The back however is rather challenging to get off. There's no release as on the previous model, you just have to use brute force. The speaker is on the back and can give pretty decent volume. Also on the back is the connector for an external GPS antennae (generally not needed unless you are in something like an RV).The keyboard is a full QWERTY keyboard, and fairly nice and tactile. Also has a nice light-up feature which can automatically detect light (or you can tweak to always activate). The number keys are colored grey which makes them easier to find and the blue switch key is completely blue rather than just having a blue dot. However, the keyboard slides out the opposite direction of the 8525 so if you used that phone, you may find yourself trying to slide this the wrong way all the time! This does also put the buttons and stylus to the left...not good for most of us that are right-handed. I also wish there was a way to lock caps and/or numbers on. You have to hold down their respective shift keys which really slows me down sometimes. Also, when fully tilted up, the soft keys at the top of the keyboard are very hard to press as they are somewhat under the screen.Now on to the buttons. There don't seem to be as many buttons on this model and they aren't as easy to customize in general. You have a dedicated Push-to-Talk button that won't let you remap it, frustrating if you never use this service. There is no longer a Comm Manager button either, which I really liked, to pull up my setting for bluetooth, wifi, etc. and turn them on and off. The internet and email buttons are now down at the bottom with all the other buttons. I expect some people will like this, I personally liked them being separate as I now often have to look to make sure I'm pushing the right button. It's not the greatest layout if you like to play games on your device. I do love the real scroll wheel (not a jog dial). Once you have a device with just jog, you'll know how nice true scroll is! The power button is really flush with the device and unlikely you will accidentally turn the device on while in a pocket or purse. Unfortunately this does mean it is not exactly easy to find that power button when it's dark out! Luckily sliding out the keyboard will also turn it on. By default the sliding makes a little chiming sound, but you can turn that off.Built-in GPS is pretty cool to have. It does take awhile to fix the satellites, there is a utility to help with that and others you can download for free. Once you have a signal, you can use it with TeleNav, something like TomTom or with various online free service like Microsoft Live or Google Maps. Lots of cool options to make use of this. However, if you want to use this to replace the navigation in your car, there's one big issue with this device, and that's the screen. It doesn't use a transreflective screen which makes it very difficult to see in bright light. This is generally not a huge problem for typical use, but if you want to use this in your car to do navigation, it may be too difficult to see from any distance if light is hitting it. You can turn up the brightness all the way but on a sunny day, you may still have problems. Make sure your navigation has spoken text directions or you may end up lost!The new camera does have the neat autofocus which you can lock on your subject before shooting the photo. It's like most phone cameras in that it is rather slow and can't handle a moving subject. For relatively stationery ones, it's actually fairly decent. Won't beat your digicam, but it's usable in a pinch.Now on to the operating system and software, this phone is using the new Windows Mobile 6. Not a huge different here from 5, biggest changes are in the messaging which handles Exchange servers a lot better, HTML emails, etc. Many people in the past used 3rd party products for email, WM6 actually does a pretty decent job with them now. It also has the new Windows Live service which lets you do instant messaging, maps, location searches, traffic, weather, news, etc. I've only just started playing with some of these features, but it looks really good. Just type in a location, search for something like a nearby restaurant and you can pull up not only the address and phone...but get directions and a map there as well! And yes, GPS is integrated. It's pretty cool. Other various MS functions like hotmail and IM are part of Windows Live as well. Pocket IE is still pretty crappy. I prefer Opera Mobile, but the free Opera Mini works pretty well for a lot of people as well.Now for the big negative...AT&T; bloatware. Apparently with all this free memory, they saw no reason to leave it for the user, instead filling it with all these extra paid-for AT&T; services and horrible game demos (time out in something like 1 minute!) Luckily there are a couple ways around this. You can soft reset the device when it starts loading all these extra apps on and skip over it that way. Or if you are a really savvy techie type like me, you can flash the device with the original HTC ROM which is much nicer than the plain AT&T; one. You do need to really spend some time learning how to do this and of course it invalidates the warranty. But you'll have a really slick device afterwards and a lot more free memory. It has a nice black theme that matches the color of the device and a really nice Today screen plugin. The dialer is much improved and easier to use as well. Google the xda-developers site for more info (again, not for the technically challenged!)I'm the type of user that plays around with a new device for weeks trying to find just the right combinations of addon programs and utilities to get it working just the way I like it. I've found all kinds of neat programs such as one that lets you configure all the buttons (adding commands for things like double-press or long-press) and another that lets you create custom profiles like a regular cell phone, but controlling things like bluetooth/Wifi being on and changing volumes, etc. Set your profiles to switch at certain times of the day or for certain types of appointments, there's so much you can control if you want to. I was hoping with the faster processor it would load up my Today screen a bit faster with everything I have on there, but it still takes awhile on the first load to render everything. Be careful though as all software does not support WM6 yet. I found that clock/alarm programs in particular did not play well with it.There's so much you can do with a Windows Mobile phone, I can't begin to list it all here. You can do streaming video (watch YouTube), use Skype or other VOIP services, even listen to your entire music collection from home using media sharing. Instant messaging, you can even use remote desktop! I even found a website that lets me stream my XM radio channels. Pretty amazing stuff.You'll definitely want to drop by the xda-developers Kaiser forums (google it) and check out some of the applications available there. Top of the list is the Kaiser Tweak which you install and run in order to adjust a lot of the somewhat annoying default settings on the Tilt. Top of the list is the often-mentioned issue with the screen turning off during a call. Run this app and you will never have that problem again. Various performance-related tweaks are available as well.Overall, this is a nice step up from the 8525 and with all the rebates currently available, a real bargain at that. I would highly recommend this to anyone that want to have a phone for doing web/email and maybe a bit more.EDIT: While I'm not able to change my initial star rating, hopefully these additional comments will get posted about the device. While I don't regret my purchase in the least, having used it now for sometime I don't have quite so glowing an opinion of it. If you read through my comments with this review as well as all the latest reviews posted, you'll see some of these talked about (problems with the speakerphone and BT, video driver issues, poor support from HTC.) I don't regret buying it at all, and find it still a great convergence device. But there are definitely some serious caveats that would make me hesitate to recommend it to new buyers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Forget the iPhone, this is the killer smartphone to get!", "unixReviewTime": 1191888000, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2007"},

(I have had an applet crash, however.)It's a speedy performer out of the box, though sometimes screen refreshes were a little slow.It turns out there's a brouhaha over a lack of tightly integrated video drivers for this device, which is capable of running MUCH faster.Along with the crashing applet (an HTC background running utility; HTC is the company that actually makes the Tilt), I really hope they come along with a better video driver.  This unit is good, and is a good Smartphone PDA, but it could do better.The keyboard is awesome.The touch screen is as sensitive as my previous PDA (iPaq 2755).Boots fast.Has a crisp, bright screen.And whose processor is NOT Intel ARM-based.

I know it's hard to see a clear protector in a small photo, but in the image my iPhone is inthis case, which perfectly covers the edges of the screen protector on all sides, so there's no chance of pulling up the corners or getting dust, etc. around the edges of the protector.  There's a cut out semi-circle for the Home button.The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff.  For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying, and then when you apply, you get a PERFECT result, straight with no bubbles whatsoever.The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card.  To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway.  It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.So you get a high quality, crystal clear, bubble-free, scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector, and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors.  And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)UPDATE 10/10/2008:  Apparently the seller is no longer selling the 3G version here.

It was a great headset and when it finally died I bought the new DS980.  The new unit is very similar to the old one, but does have some improvements.The battery life is improved in the new version and usually lasts through most of my day. I would still like more and would accept a larger unit in order to get it.The 980 allows you to use a menu on the headset to do several things including select a contact to call (if your phone supports this). I suppose this is nice.  Personally I don't find this useful, partly because my old eyes aren't good enough to read the menu without glasses, and partly because it is difficult to push the right buttons to get through the menus and select the right thing. Its much easier for me to grab the phone and use it to do what I need to do.I personally don't like the \"mirror finish\" on the 980, but that is personal preference. I guess it looks cool.The sound quality is excellent. I wouldn't put it against stereophile quality phones with a multi-thousand dollar amp behind them, but for playing mp3 songs from my phone it is just as good as any plug in earbuds.  The earbuds are comfortable to wear for long hours and do a good job keeping out noise. It comes with three different size pads; be sure to experiment with them and see which is best for you.Mostly what I like is that the unit hangs on a lanyard around my neck and the buds can be in or out of my ears. It is relatively inconspicuous. I can wear it around the office and no one really knows whether I'm on the phone or listening to music or listening to an audiobook. I talk to myself a lot, so conversing with someone doesn't give me away. If I'm not using it, it hangs around my neck and doesn't get lost.The only thing I really don't like is the stupid little plug on the charger. It is a proprietary thing that is prone to breaking and not connecting properly even if it isn't broken. I really wish Sony would get with the program and use a mini or micro USB connector.

If the back metal clip is not desired (some may and some may not like the metal clip), the metal clip can be easily but permanently removed by cutting the threads that attach it to the back band (I used a single edge razor blade to do this and it left no marring or holes in the fabric of the case/pouch).  This results in the case/pouch being slimmer, more easier to handle and lay down and more comfortable when placed in the pants pocket.  By just removing the metal clip and the fabric it is attached to (the D ring will be removed to), but leaving the back fabric band alone, the case/pouch can still be worn horizontal on a belt if so desired (belt looped through the back fabric band).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect For Galaxy Note 2", "unixReviewTime": 1358467200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2013"},

The only other thing that you may run across is when there is wind, it completely drowns out the ability to hear or for the other person to hear you, so you have to use your hand to protect from the wind when outside. Other headsets of lower quality seem to be able to handle the wind a little better, even though there is still a lot of noise and you have to wait till you're out of the wind or use your hand to protect the speaker.Overall, you are getting what you pay for.

The problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear. It comes with several ear bud sizes and two ear loop sizes. I tried them all, on both ears.

A friend had recently purchased a Jawbone and told me her friends picked up her call from an airport, and they said it sounded great. That was appealing to me, so off I went.The 1st Jawbone was dead on arrival out of the box. It wouldn't light up to charge. AT&T; cheerfully replaced it a few hours later the same day. 2 weeks later, the wire earloop, about the diameter of a paperclip, snapped where it goes through the main body of the Jawbone. They ship 6 in total, which are either right or left ear only. The second failed about two weeks later. The issue seems to be that the loop material is either too brittle, or to small in diameter in the name of fashion. The shape of the Jawbone is a little awkward to carry with you when it's not being worn. In a computer case, it can't really be flat, so the pressure from the side of the bag snaps it. The same thing happened when I put it in my jacket pocket. When I put on the seat belt in the car, it gently rubbed against the coat and number two was toast. The third one snapped in half when I was putting it on.One more thing - bring a friend or a mirror when you go to look at one. It pulls my ear funny, so it sticks out, which never happened with the Motorola. I am going to try the Blue Ant next, and see how that one fairs.

When I took the Plantronics Explorer 330 for a test drive last week the first two things that stood out immediately was the overall comfort and the superb call quality. Even outside on a windy day, performance was better then I expected.Pairing up to both my cell phone and PDA was a breeze. Mounted with a flexible silicone ear hook, rotating to either ear takes just seconds. The earpiece has nice comfortable feel to it. So comfortable in fact that on more then one occasion I forgot that I was wearing it.Outfitted with a multifunction toggle, I easily controlled the volume by sliding the toggle forward or back. Answering, disconnecting, transferring and last number redialing was done with the touch of the button. The only ping on this product is that sometimes the toggle feels a little stiff. The onboard LED flashes an intermittent blue when fully charged and continuously when in use. I get a red flashing signal when my battery is low and a pink flashing to remind me of missed calls.I like the fact that I can pair it with more than one piece of Bluetooth gear. When I was in a crowded grocery store the clarity of incoming and outgoing calls was outstanding. With my older 510 model I was unable to wear it in that environment because of its tendency to pick up almost every surrounding noise. Callers also noted the improved clarity even when I was outside on a windy day. My battery life on this feather weight model was about 7 hours in talk mode during the week and 2 days on the weekend.The Plantronics Exployer 330 comes with a charging cradle, instructions and a one year product warranty. The company's website is loaded with useful information and lists working toll free technical support phone numbers.Overall I am quite pleased with my Plantronics Explorer 330 Headset.

The Curve is a full qwerty keyboard smartphone and has the ability to use wifi to surf the internet and make calls via UMA.However...most services won't work with the Curve UNLESS you sign up for a data plan with T-Mobile.  You would think the wifi ability would have some sort of push email function for free, but it does not, you have to pay for that.  The wi-fi only allows you to do basic web browsing.  Web pages are not html style and are mobile style.  Looks like crap actually.  Only real good use is to read some news or articles.  You cannot use features such as Yahoo Go, Google Maps, or Push E-Mail.  The push email goes through the blackberry server so it is not T-mobile's fault.  $10 for push email, or $20 for email and data.Blackberry's are powerful devices, but you have to pay for that full power to be unleashed.  Get the data plan.  You could also use this as a  media player, as it plays back mp3 and video, but you will have to buy a separate memory card for that as the one supplied is only 256 mb.However, since this is a hotspot enabled phone, I use this for work since I can talk all day and night without having my minutes deducted via the hotspot@home feature ($10 per household, all UMA phones on the plan can use it for one charge).  The speaker phone on this thing is loud, sharp and amazing.  It's probably the lightest Blackberry I have used besides the Pearl.Calls via UMA are clear, and sharp.  No problems so far.If you are looking for a UMA phone, go with the Blackberry Curve.

This isn't always the case with some other BB's. I was particularly pleased to discover that OperaMini installed and performed flawlessly. There has been much talk on various boards claiming that T-Mobile has deliberately set their phones so that they won't run third party apps. My experience says otherwise.The fact that the 8320 has  WiFi was a huge selling point for me. Our house is located in what may very will be the most cell signal challenged spot in the county. This BB instantly located our AirPort signal and I was finally able to to make calls from home, via the UMA feature. Emails load very quickly, and it performs like a real champ when it's time to send a SMS or MMS. The screen is very bright and clear. It does a reasonably good job in direct sunlight, but then I have yet to find a phone whose screen delivers as promised in that area. It is also very sharp and easy to see. That's quite an accomplishment considering my poor eyesight. The 2.0 megapixel camera is pretty useful with it's zoom and flash abilities. Under the right set of circumstances it's capable of producing some pretty good photos.  It also has a SD card slot so that you can store larger media files, or whatever else your heart desires. The web browsing experience is better than you you might expect. It also features voice dialing. I was impressed liked the phone's search function. I don't know if it is typical of other BlackBerries, but I found it to be extremely fast and very useful.The reception is better than other phones that I have owned in the past. It it also very good looking and feels solidly made. The rubberized sides give the 8320 an extra secure grip. Finally, the real QWERTY keyboard is (for me at last) a huge improvement over the Pearl's Sure Type system. The keys are raised and separated just enough to make typing quickly possible, and this from a serious klutz. It also has spell check as part of it's core programming. That is something I desperately need.When the iPhone first hit the scene I felt left out of the party because T-Mobile wouldn't be a seller. But I have had nothing other than positive experiences with T-Mobile. I don't work for or have any financial interest in the company, so I can honestly state that T-Mobile tech support ranks right up there with Apple. So why should I surrender that comfort level to try someone new?

WiFi and stereo Bluetooth, and it even supports VOIP (i.e., Tmo's @home service). Email and messaging is superb, I do lots of txt and get IM notifications, plus all my IM clients on this phone and the conversations are all integrated into one list, very handy. I have the Blackberry Unlimited data plan + unlimited texts, which i consider necessary because this slick messaging interface tends to lead to excessive messaging. But that's why you get a Blackberry, right?I had a Tmo Dash before this, and this just blows it out of the water. They have a similar feature set, but the Dash's camera is all but unusable, takes lousy pictures, the screen is hard to see in bright daylight, and the Blackberry OS makes Win Mobile seem clunky and confusing by comparison. It would be nice if the BB took video too, but cell phone video kind of sucks anyway.If you're one of those highly connected social networking types, there is a Facebook app, numerous IM clients, and a Flickr uploader that makes posting pictures effortless. I installed Google Maps, and even though the Tmo version of the Curve has no GPS, the gMaps application gets it close enough by triangulating your location. It won't give you turn by turn nav but it really helps if you're lost, plus it's close enough so that using the traffic overlay is very helpful to avoid delays. The internet browsing is very satisfactory and superior to the Dash's mobile IE. Also, installing all these add-on apps is extremely easy. There are even some cool free versions of games that are quite fun to play with the little trackball.I keep logged in to all these different things, and Bluetooth running all the time with WiFi wherever available - this is one busy little phone - but the processor is more than adequate to the task of keeping up, and the battery life is impressive with all these things running. With the Dash, \"out of memory\" errors trying to run the worthless camera were common, and the WiFi, Bluetooth, and any kind of multimedia usage would drain the battery way too fast. With the Dash, I had to constantly make sure I was being conservative with what I had running, and that's just no fun at all.Multimedia capabilities are very nice, I have a 4 gig micro SD and some stereo bluetooth peripherals (i recommendAltec Lansing T515 Portable Speaker for Stereo Bluetooth Phone) and you've got a very slick portable entertainment system.The little scroll wheel was a bit awkward for me at first, but now when I try to navigate other phones, I really miss it. If you've not had a BB before, it's a good idea to run through the tutorial when you set it up, there are some very very handy keyboard shortcuts that will make things much easier.All in all, this is a fantastic smartphone that can actually keep up with me, and that's saying a lot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "BB Curve vs. TMO Dash - Blackberry wins!", "unixReviewTime": 1215820800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2008"},

In particular, my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility, usability, and quality. So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset, the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a, even though the Jabra site claims, \"It Will Work :) \". The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone, so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive. I tried my phone with other headsets (OEM wired one, Aliph Jawbone, Moto H700) which all worked fully and flawlessly, so the phone is not at fault. I went through severl procedures with Jabra, who ultimately replaced the headset, all without success. Also, my older phones (an S710a and T637) woked perfectly well. So there's clearly a compatibility issue, once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second, the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10. On the JX-10, all \"headset\" functions (initiate call via voice dialing, answer call, end call) required a single short button press, and \"handsfree\" functions (reject incoming call, redial last call, call waiting switch, etc.) needed only a single long button press. That couldn't be easier. The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse, such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions. Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability, and lost it.Finally, the BT8040's \"eargel version 2\" does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in, or falling out of, your ear. The separately sold Jabra Eargels v.1 (which I used with my JX-10) are more stable and more comfortable. Sadly, these v.1 eargels do not fit this headset.With the BT8040, Jabra's maintained their other attributes - functionality, call quality and volume, build quality, small size and light weight - hence I give it 2 stars instead of one. But the incompatibility is unacceptable, especially with Sony Ericsson phones (the kings of Bluetooth).

I couldn't use it at full loud except for the highway test.  It is very pocketable and reasonably unobtrusive.  It \"flaps\" against my ear when I move my head, though it's never fallen off.  And, audio quality to callers in noisy environments is significantly below that of the other two headsets.  In the highway test, I was unintelligible to callers.  The H710 pairs with both phones, but echo cancellation doesn't work when connected with the Uniden -- I hear my own voice with a a delay.The BT8040 is my favorite all-around headset.

Very light weight, but solid construction.2. Turns on and off with the swing out of the boom mike.3. Very good audio quality reported on the far end.4. Very good audio quality on receive, with ample volume available.5. Very good audio reports from those I am talking to. No one has yet detected that I was even using a headset.6. Suprising battery life, which is a good thing, given the battery is not user replaceable.7. Very easy setup! Pairing, actually \"auto-pairing\" was a piece of cake and the instructions provided worked perfectly with the W755 phone.8. No dropped calls!9. Once paired, both headset and phone remained paired in future use, all one has to do is open the boom mike and automagically the link is made. (assuming the phone has BlueTooth turned on).10. Voice command with this headset and the W755 works exactly as it should. (hint: change your contact names to phoenetically match ...i.e., spell them in a way that they are likely to be pronounced... this helps voice recognition a lot, and I've been doing things this way for voice command for years.)11. Ergonomics: fits my ear fine, and stays put during normal physical activity. I have not tested it jogging. Amazingly small footprint. Clever use of a minimal number of buttons and multi-colored LEDs (Call/Answer;Volume Up/Down). Pressing both up/down volume while headset is open (and not connected to the charger, or in a call), shows battery life remaining in 3 colors, Red/Yellow/Green, which corresponds to hours of talk time left.Cons:1. Charger connection is micro-USB. You either have to carry another charger (the one supplied), or get an adapter cable from Mini-USB > Micro-USB in order to use your existing charger.2. No user replaceable battery, with a maximum number of charges specified at 400. Basically, it appears Motorola expects you to throw this device away when the Li-Ion battery will no longer charge. I would prefer the ability to send the unit in for battery replacement and not further contribute to the burgeoning electronic waste issue. If you're a big talker and max out at 6.5 hours per day, you will get 400 days of life from the H710. One thing that is clear, don't recharge until necessary, as you are counting down from 400 on the life of the headset.Summary:A very small and light, solidly built, Blue Tooth headset that is feature rich and an outstanding performer, both in connectivity and audio quality.

Now that's some audio amplification!2) I haven't asked the people on the other line how my audio sounded, but I've never heard any complaints - i.e. that my voice was too soft or inaudible or static - so whatever echo and noise cancellation technology Motorola uses, it apparently works.3) Function button works seamlessly with my Pearl's voice-dial feature - just press and hold it down for a second and speak whom you'd like to call.4) Quick start-up - it takes about 3 seconds for it to start up/sync with your phone.5) Very stylish and lightweight - wear it and forget it. The power/charge/function light is also very cool! lights up a very bright and stylish green/yellow/red/blue, depending on function.Cons:1) Doesn't fit very snuggly around the ears. I've tried testing it by shaking my head slowly, and if you don't find that \"sweet spot,\" it will flop around your ears.

Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710.  I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone.  I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them.  I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry.  It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series.  I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset.  I'm really rooting for the PRO.  I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely.  The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears.  I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro.

McKown", "helpful": [14, 14], "reviewText": "After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a \"dog incident\", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head.  I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone.  All three of these phones support multipoint.  The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all.  All three worked well with the Centro.All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments.  The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments.  The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers.  The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller).The H710 has the best \"user interface\".  Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset.  It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant.  The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs.  The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710.  In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface.  The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach.  The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on.  Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you.Pocketability is a big concern for me.  The 510 isn't really pocketable.  I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it.  The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable.  The BT8040 is a micro-sized \"brick\" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable.Headset fit is another bit concern.  The 510 is the most comfortable for me.  The BT8040 is second, which surprised me.  The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable.  The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are.  All of the headsets are secure.  The 510 fits well as a result of its design.  The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light.  The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it.Battery life is good on all units.  I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard.  However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle.I found the H710 to be the worst of the three.  It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others.  It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear.  The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers.

It is _nearly_ perfect in all aspects, the only minor drawback compared to its predecessor, the H700, is that it has a micro-USB charging connector rather than a mini-USB one (I have tons of mini-USB peripherals, including my cell phone, camera, etc...)The Jawbone CAN be a good and comfortable fit, if the anatomy of your ear agrees with it. I was lucky that way, it was actually the most comfortable headset I have used. Even for me, though, it was not \"instant love\", it took a bit of training to learn how to put it on correctly in a hurry (i.e. when receiving an incoming call). The ear loops (4 different ones included in the package) are very stiff, and I can see how they would easily break after a while. The sound quality was excellent while in my car driving - even across a noisy concrete bridge there would be no way for the other party to tell. Also, incoming sound quality was great - the volume adjusts based on background noise, and the ear plugs are rubberized and block most other noise. It is also a good-looking headset; it matched my phone (a black Nokia N95 8GB) quite well. My main two issues with it were the charging connector (a proprietary one, and only a USB charging cable was included; also not that easy to plug/unplug), and the fact that the power-on time (from off to connected) was a bit too long (timing it, I got anywhere from 9 to 13 seconds..). I prefer to keep my headset turned off when not in use (battery life, connection-time issues.. etc.)The Plantronics was also great with respect to sound quality; I would say though that it did not quite beat the Jawbone while driving in a car.. (I did not try either one while walking outside in wind though). I did not quite like the large size though (my pockets are full enough already with my cell phone, keys, wallet...), and as someone mentioned, it would seem that it could easily wear out after prolonged pocket-use... Finally, I did not like the proprietary charging connector. (Give me standard mini-USB please; or else micro-USB will work too).The Motorola H700 and H710 were for me the answer to nearly every grievance I have with bluetooth headsets. You unfold the microphone boom to power it on (and automatically answer any incoming call); fold it back to power off. Simple, elegant. No confusion about whether or not the headset is already powered on or off when an incoming call arrives (I.e. no \"Do I need to hold the power button down for a while to power it on, or a simple tap to just answer?\" quandries). The power-on-and-connect is also one of the fastest I have seen on any headset (about the same as my old H300, and way faster than either the Jawbone or the 510). Sound quality is exceptional in either - though maybe more so with the H710 (better noise reduction, and, like the Jawbone, it adjusts your ear volume automatically to accommodate for background noise). Since you would normally keep these turned off, as opposed to leaving them on standby, a single charge will normally last you for weeks and weeks (depending on usage of course). Another plus is that they use industry standard charging connectors (mini-USB and micro-USB, respectively), so you can easily share wall/car/computer chargers with other peripherals. Finally, they are an easy fit - no one should have issues getting them on in a hurry (though for me, I actually preferred the \"firm\" fit of the Jawbone...).My only issue with the H700 (and this has been fixed in the H710) is an extremely short range; if I left my phone in my pocked while talking on the headset, I would hear some subtle crackling; take the phone out and hold it in my hand and it was OK. While OK for \"car use\", I ended up returning it and getting the H710 mainly for this reason.Good Luck in your own quest for perfection.

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here's my report of each adapter:White adapter received from seller \"CRONUZ\" - 1 star:The cord feels flimsy. The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery. From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material, I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it doesn't break before that.White adapter received from seller \"eTECH\" (mailing label said \"iflash Inc\") - 1 star:The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.Black adapterreceived from seller \"Eforcity\" (not this listing) - 3 stars:This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.Black adapterreceived from seller \"Elago Design\" (not this listing) - 5 stars:First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.  Most of them would rather just give you a refund because they know they are shipping a different brand than what is listed.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "See pictures above!", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"},

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here's my report of each adapter:Black adapter received from seller \"Eforcity\" - 3 stars:This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.Black adapter received from seller \"Elago Design\" - 5 stars:First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.White adapterreceived from seller \"CRONUZ\" (not this listing) - 1 star:The cord feels flimsy. The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery. From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material, I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it doesn't break before that. This seller also sells a black one on this listing. I would think it's the same quality as the white one they sell.White adapterreceived from seller \"eTECH\" (mailing label said \"iflash Inc\" / not this listing) - 1 star:The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.  Most of them would rather just give you a refund because they know they are shipping a different brand than what is listed. If you don't get a refund, leave negative feedback. Hopefully this will help stop sellers from shipping different items than the listings show.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 Stars is only for the one from Elago!", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"},

One day I accidentally, dropped one of the adapters into my soda, and after that, it works when it wants to, now I use the other one, and that works a lot better then the other adapter I dropped in my soda, but it still has its days where you can hear distortion.

Many times I'm left to wonder where the sound is coming from, even when I'm holding the phone right in front of me.Put in an 8 gig micro SD card, slap on a good pair of cans, and you can throw away all your iPods and digital music players.I have since moved on to theNokia N85 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot - U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper), in which its OLED screen blows the N95's old TFT screen out of the water, as well as most other phones I'm sure.But audio-wise I think the N95 is better, and for a phone that's several years old, it can still hold its own on the other fronts as well - AWESOME photo quality and very decent video quality.Although it's fat almost like a soap bar (as opposed to a \"candy bar\" like other phones), I very much like how it feels in my hand - gives you a very secure feeling (I feel like I'm always about to drop my N85).The soft rubber of the back has a very nice feel as well (although prone to marks and scratches because of its rubbery material).The feel of the buttons is very firm, tactile, and responsive, but prone to wear like most phones.On the downside, the Real player sucks - you'll have to install a third party player to enjoy all your different video files.Overall, highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best audio on a phone ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1231545600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2009"},

Could be a seller mistake, but since it's in my favor, I won't complain. I wear hearing aids, so I had to get something that would work with a T-Coil loop. I have a non-powered version that is strictly for listening. The fancy one I purchased from the hearing aid manufacturer amplified everything, so it didn't function as I needed. This works perfectly. Only amplifies what is being piped through without adjusting the volume of the hearing aids themselves. Perfect for gym use and while working in the yard with over the ear protection. Basically, it works.Now that I've had the Jabra awhile, I wanted to update my review. I use it primarily with a Music-Link Stereo Hearing Aid Compatible Headset (http://www.amazon.com/Music-Link-Stereo-Hearing-Compatible-Headset/dp/B0030C3IFY/ref=sr_1_109?ie=UTF8&qid;=1394029299&sr;=8-109&keywords;=t-coil+loop). Since I already have a T-Coil bluetooth loop that works for handsfree driving and the like, I wanted something that would allow my use in the gym. The ComPilot is awesome, except that increasing the sound does so by increasing the hearing aid volume. The Jabra (on the other hand) does exactly what I wanted.

I really like the GPS, and use it a lot in my car, but its output options for audio on a motorcycle are really limited. It does do bluetooth, but only to a device that self identifies as a 'HiFI stereo device'. Helmet-ready 'HiFi stereo' kit is seriously expensive, given the need for sound isolation (=earplugs). The Jabra BT3030 works perfectly for this application. The supplied earphones provide sufficient ear-plug effect, and are comfortable for long periods (hours) under a helmet. They also provide good quality stereo sound. For me, for this application, this is an excellent, sensibly priced solution.The Jabra is also an excellent handsfree phone headset, and also is excellent at playing music stored on my phone's SD card, and though I never felt the need for either of those functions before, having tried it, I shall be using it for both.The only 'problem' is that all three devices are 'too smart' for me to be able to use all three functions at the same time. All three devices can connect to two other devices simultaneously; the phone to the headset and the GPS; the GPS to the phone and the headset; and the headset to the phone and the GPS. And all have logic allowing a signal on one input to intelligently overide the signal on the other input. So if I connect them all at once, the GPS gives me navigation directions, which the headset picks up, but the phone also detects the directions, decides that they need to be passed on to the headset (since the phone is not 'in use') and repeats them about a quarter second later to the headset, The headset starts relaying the instruction from the GPS, then gets the instructions from the phone, decides a message from the phone overides an (assumed) 'music input', and overides the GPS instruction with the same instruction a quarter second later from the phone, but only during the actual words, it flip-flops back to the other signal in the silences between words! The result is what I can only describe as a 'stuttering echo' or an 'echoing stutter' :DSince I don't want to talk on the phone while I'm riding, I just switch off the phone while riding, and switch off the GPS and switch on the phone when I stop riding. Works for me. :)If you wanted to do all three at once, I'm not sure even the expensive gear could solve that problem...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for a sensible price", "unixReviewTime": 1252627200, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2009"},

I use it with the Jabra A120s on my iPod as well as with my Cyber Blue Bluetooth USB dongle.With the a120s I get about 40 feet away line of site (cubicles) or less than 20 feet through standard home walls. With the CyberBlue dongle however, I can use it all the way into the restroom which is over 60' away & through 2 walls & a bathroom stall.When paired with the A120s you can only control the volume, but with the dongle I can play/pause & skip forward & back.I use this with my Oticon Tego P hearing aids & it works so much better than my Eli bluetooth adapter. The Eli would last MAYBE 1.5 hours for music, a bit more for talk. The BT3030 lasts about 5-7 hours depending on the volume I have it set to. It's really no larger than a real dogtag at 5.5cmlx3.5wx1cm thick.Being so small, it hangs from a ball link chain (see pic) or from your zipper if you want. It charges via a USB adapter. Linking it with the a120s is NOT mentioned in the documentation, but here's how it's done:1: turn on the a120s (make sure it's plugged into your audio source)2: turn on the BT30303: wait about 20 seconds.4: that's it.For bluetooth phones or PCs it's only slightly trickier as you need to use the password which is \"0000\" but once they are paired up, all you need to do is select \"connect\" on the device to be listened to & then turn on the BT3030.Even though there are bluetooth headphones out there, I like the BT3030 because you can use it with ANY headphone that can attach to a 3.5mm jack. In my case it's my hearing aid, but you can use your favorite set.The ONLY downside to it is that you need a usb to charge it and you can't continue using it while it's charging.

Note that there are two versions, one with the USB Bluetooth adapter and one without.  The one without is widely available, the other, not so much (and costs more).  You only need the adapter if your PC or laptop does not already have a bluetooth device built in.  My Insignia player has bluetooth built in.Setup: Super.  Worked well right away.  I just followed the instructions (hold the on/off button for 7 seconds, turn on player and use search, select, done).  Once paired, they worked great.  The headset buttons can be used for play/pause, next/previous, ffwd/rew, and volume +/- and everything worked well.  The buttons take a little practice to find by feel, but have raised markings and after awhile I got the hang of it.  They do require quite a firm press, so you won't accidentally active one while adjusting your headset or anything.Sound quality:  In my opinion, excellent for a bluetooth set. Certainly as good as your average wired set.  There was nice presence and stereo image, no noise, crisp percussion, decent bass (not boomy, thank god), in short, very pleasant.  I am very happy with the sound quality.  They have plenty of volume, nice S/N ratio, good overall sound.  I compared them to a wired set I like (panasonic) and they were very comparable.  This set has a more open sound to me which I actually like. (While they may not be as good as your best set of cans, they are perfectly fine. And no damn wires!)Bluetooth functionality:  I have not yet tried the combo phone/music setup, just using with my player for now.  The connection is solid and the range is great. I tested up to 40' away or more with no problems which exceeds the 33' stated.  I left my player downstairs on the charger and walked upstairs into a bedroom.  There was a drop out when I passed behind a wall and fireplace (metal liner probably) but that was it, I had full sound all the way upstairs and in the bedroom, no problems at all.  This is far better than I expected from a bluetooth set.They support bluetooth 2.0 and 1.2 and A2DP, AVRCP, and HSP -in short everything you could want,e.g. full stereo hi-fi sound, device control, hands free operation (i.e. voice dial if your phone supports it).  Pretty good feature set that touches all the main bases.Nits:  This is my first 'behind the head' style set and it took me a bit to get used to them.  But after awhile I think I've adjusted.  The \"frame\" is sort of cheap, plastic looking, but seems OK (pretty much like most sets of this style I've seen).  I pulled and twisted a little and nothing came apart. ;)Reasonably comfortable, but could be a little better.  I still find the small, lightweight over the head phones the most comfortable. That said, a 3 hour session was no problem though I did need a bit of a rest after that. (The over the ear part is the issue for me, it causes some discomfort after awhile.)Overall, I would certainly recommend these as a great BT set for the money if you can still find them. I was pleasantly surprised.Update 9/18/08:  The model listed here comes without the USB key.  I got the model NS-DTHDST which comes with the USB Bluetooth key which adds Bluetooth capability to your laptop or PC (it comes with the drivers and software on CD).  I installed the sw on my laptop and it went well. Paired easily.  Now I can play MP3's on my laptop and listen w/o wires, also DVD's, -all audio goes to the headsets when connected automatically (well, within my limited tests so far, anyway).  Sounds great.This headset also has a built-in mic so you can use it with cell phones -or the laptop.  I assume you could use this as a gaming headset, but I haven't tried it.If they were over the head instead of behind, they'd be perfect.  I'm getting used to 'em, but I still prefer the over the head style.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great set for the money!", "unixReviewTime": 1221436800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2008"},

I had carried my original in a standard-issue soft belt case that can be purchased just about anywhere. It's made for RIM, and has a little oval silver medallion on the security strap with \"Blackberry\" engraved on it. One day, sticking my BB back into the case, I inadvertently stuffed the strap in with it. In the next hour of walking, getting in an out of the car, etc., that little engraved medallion gouged a fugly deep pattern of scratches into the screen. Also, I found that the Curve's finish is extremely susceptible to scratches and dings, not from misuse, but from day-to-day handling. For instance, the rear of the case is, well...curved! Resting on my desk between calls had worn some fine scratches into the silver finish.Anyway, I wanted to protect my replacement Curve, so I researched HD protective cases, and settled on the OtterBox in basic black (no Bumble-Bee look for me, thanks.) I bought one at a GREAT price on Amazon, and received it about a week later.Let me tell you, this is the BEST case I have ever owned for any mobile device! I found a review on YouTube that demonstrated installation, and that decided me. Some of the comments posted there ridiculed the guy for buying a case that they perceived as being bulky, ugly, and industrial looking, complaining that it ruined the sleek fashion profile of the Curve. OK, well, I didn't buy the BB to improve my fashion image. It is a business tool to me and gets constant use all day every day. The OtterBox is all but bullet-proof, encasing the Curve in a hard shell which is then sealed and cushioned by an outer soft silicon skin, which is then further encased in the snap-in belt holster. I elected NOT to use the provided flexible transparent combination screen-keyboard-back membrane. I need the full tactile experience of the keyboard, and the membrane seemed better suited to use in a thunderstorm than to how I use my device. The remaining components of the case protect my BB to an extreme degree. I've had it and have been using it now for about three weeks, and I LOVE this thing! The outer silicon skin improves the grip in the hand and helps prevent the BB sliding off the console in the car. All BB buttons are usable through raised ribbed buttons in the silicon skin. The screen and keyboard are recessed enough into the hard shell and silicon skin to protect them against all but the most direct impact damage, and the holster carries the device screen-inward so that it's fully covered. The belt holster does contain the standby magnet the BB needs to conserve power.This is a high-quality, beefy, no-nonsense, industrial-design case.

The only two gripes I had with this case... the clear plastic overlay needed a thorough cleaning every month or two, and the air bubbles were hard to remove from the screen (even with the application card).

The title to this review summarizes these headphones.  That said, let me start with what I did like:Pros:-Good design, the mic is on the left side, so you never have to wonder which side is right, and which is left.-The mic is separated from the answer button, this is great as it keeps the mic small so you don't have a large piece of plastic hanging off your ear.-Very stylish and sturdy (though I didn't care for the carry bag much).-Stop/Next/Answer button works perfectly.-Cord extension is great.So far so good.  Now for the one con: audio quality.  The bass is non-existent.  I have owned canal earphones before and I know what a good seal feels like (so fit was not an issue).  I also tried all three silicone pieces before settling on the mid-sized piece.I also burned the headphones in overnight as maximo recommends, but still mediocre bass.I also tried setting the EQ on my iPhone to \"Loudness\", but that did not help.  I'm not a bass head, but I do like solid bass response and was quite disappointed.Outside of the bass issue, i also found that there was focus on mid range without great highs (i wonder if this is to emphasize audio conversations, but I can't say for sure.Finally, the design of the silicone eartips doesn't not create a good seal.  You may have a different experience with your ear, so take that with a grain of salt.My last set of headphones was made by skull-candy and i found the earpieces there to be much better.In the end, I sent them back and am looking at ultimatebuds fs1.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good design, mediocre sound", "unixReviewTime": 1218672000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2008"},

In addition to in house chargers, I put a car holder in my vehicle in the lower left corner of the windshield and hid the cables under a dash mat to the stereo.  The install was fairly simple since I could place the antenna outside and fish the thin cable through the hatchback, then put the flat panel booster behind the phone mount with the amp under a seat.PRO :  comes with all antennas and proper terminationsPRO :  new flat antenna works with phones that no longer have a car adapterPRO :  switch is on the cigarette lighter plug if your lighter is always hot and you need to turn it offNOTE: Phone needs to be secured into a mount, with the antenna close behind.  With the laws being passed about no one handed driving on the cell, most people have migrated to a mount simply to comply - the inside antenna works well in this case.RESULT - installation was simplenitpick - LED for being \"on\" can be hard to see - its visable at night but in full sun hard to tell.  Not an issue since the lighter sockets get turned off when the vehicle is off.nitpick - DOES NOT send 4G LTE signal through (700 mhz) but that signal seems to be stronger than the 3g signal anyways.Verizon has alot of CDMA handoffs that are strictly cell to cell.  CDMA was designed so that a soft handoff could be made using both cells, and a 3rd to ensure no dropped data or calls, but I have not seen that feature used and experienced calls where one side was dead or where alot of cutouts happened in the mountains.  Now I have 4 bars/4 100% of the time - before it would drop to 1, 2, 3, or 4.  My vehicle telematics system is on ATT and shows its signal strength on the display when using it - seldom does att achieve even 2 bars here, and their antenna is external built into the car!  The ATT network has several times been unavailable for car data which seems to correspond to people who have iphones on verizon vs ATT - same phone, but terrible experiences w/ ATT.  It is unfortunate you do not have 2 real options with att and verizon due to ATT's weaker signal.  When cellular was first planned it was a duopoly with 2 options.  Now with PCS competition and confusion as to roaming on pcs you end up with one strong carrier nationwide.  Original analog cellular phones could be moved between carriers but today the phone is almost disposable since verizon and att chose incompatible digital systems.I have used wilson equipment since the analog days - on an offroad trip years ago to the middle of Nevada with no service, I was able to stop and make a call using the wilson amplifier and a high gain directional antenna to a cell site 83 miles away in Bishop, CA.  I dialed *611 and asked the technician what city I was in - not the usual call - he told me I was in Bishop, CA and I explained I was dialing from the middle of nowhere, NV 83 miles east of Bishop (their cell site was high up in the mountains and we were in the flatland - combined with the amplifier and high gain antenna I had full service camping at night)I have found wilson to be a quality brand that stands the test of time and recommend them to friends who live way out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great kit, ships complete, deals with newer phones that lack external antennas", "unixReviewTime": 1349136000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2012"},

I tried a number of different mounting locations on the windshield and tried using the adapter to attach it to the dash, but it would always fall off - usually very quickly.Now that I've attached the suction cup to the dashboard with silicon sealant, I'm pretty happy with this solution.

We held out against HD TV until our old TV died.  When we finally got HD we were amazed so much we ended up rewatching nearly our entire DVD collection to see everything we have been meeting.I had the same reaction when I first tried these ear buds. I was amazed at the sharpness of the high tones.  The first song I listened to was the dresden dolls and I could make out every drum beat and each key stroke on the piano rang out.  I really was like HD audio without any changes to the media or ipod. It took a while to be able to just be listening to music again, I was so impressed by the clarity.There were two big reasons I wanted these head phones. First I wanted to be able to listen to my Ipod touch on my bus commute without having to crank up the volume.  This worked perfectly, I can now greatly reduce the volume and get far more clarity than I was getting before with the buds that came with the ipod.  Watching movies is also far easier now because the isolation makes hearing dialog much easier.  The second reason I got these was to use with the upcoming iPhone 3G.  I am looking forward to using it when I get one.Here are the Pro's and Con's as I see them.ProsThese have by far the best sound I have ever experienced in headphones. They are comfortable, or at least after a couple of days to get used to the feel of them.  Once properly inserted, I had full mobility with no fears of them slipping out.  I was worried about replacement covers, but then I looked into the box again and found the two bags that contained dozens of replacement covers - very nice touch.ConsThese are the first isolating headphones I have used.  It does cause some strange internal sounds, like if you try to eat while listening to music, the chewing noises are very loud (kind of like chewing with your fingers in your ears.) Also there is some noise that gets transmitted from the cords into the ears. Also, they seem a little overpackaged, or at least the version I got. I still feel a little uncomfortable with the price, $180 is steep for me, and now that I have tried them, I'm not sure if I can go back.

I'm even happier with the HF2's.One concern that I always have had with the ER6i's is that the cable always seemed like it could snap away from the earbuds.  Now, that has never happened to me in the year of constant use in New York City - but still, they seem fragile.  The same connection in the HF2's has been redesigned and now it looks very sturdy.  The wires are connected to the earbuds by a sturdy rubberized-plastic anchor piece, built right into the earbud housing.The cord is about six inches shorter than my ER6i's, but is still plenty long to have the phone/player tucked in my back pocket.  Wires seem sturdy and is one solid cable all the way down to the male plug, which looks cleaner (instead of two smaller cables stuck together like the ER6i's).The voice/microphone hangs at just the right level to my mouth and works easily.  There is a little 'bump' switch that sticks out and you use that to activate the mic and take/hang up on calls.  Works exactly as it should and you don't have to worry where it is . . you just put your thumb there and trust that it will 'click'.The sound is fantastic - nice and clean.  I know these might seem expensive, but if you love music and don't want to destroy your ears with overly cranked audio - then invest in a good pair of earbuds.  With these isolator type earbuds, I can totally hear everything in the music - even on the subway - and keep the overall sound level down.  I probably listen to music at less than half the volume on these earbuds than most people do with regular earbuds - and have a much better listening experience.My first pair of high-end earbuds were the Ultimate Ears super.fi 5 Pros.  Those were great, but I did have a problem with my first set and had to get a replacement pair.  Those also suffered from the same disconnection, cable to earbud, and I stopped using them.  They had a great sound -nice and full - but I always felt like the earbud was too big and heavy, and wrapping the stiff cable around the back of my ear was a bit much.My second pair of high-end earbuds were the ER6i's - great full sound, very bassy.  Nice and light, easy to put in and remove, and have proven to be very sturdy (I'm pretty rough on equipment).The HF2's are the next step in audio for me.  The sound is extremely clear and balanced.  In some ways the bass isn't as big as the ER6i's- but I think in the better way, meaning the overall sound is more accurately representative of the music.  It's like there's more presence to the sound, meaning I can listen to things even quieter but still enjoy hearing every instrument or nuance to a song.  The bass end has more clarity rather than pump.Overall, I love 'em.  Cheers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extremely Clean Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1216252800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2008"},

I use it very little for music but extensively for watching movies, shows, etc. The stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know, besides medicore sound quality they are just so uncomfortable so I was on the look out for something more comfortable for myself and something with great sound for my husband who uses his ipod touch every day on his 1 1/2 hour commute to/from NYC.What we ended up with was a pair of these and a pair of the vmoda'sV-MODA Vibe Earbuds - Gunmetal Blackwhich retail for about $100 less.I had already decided these would be mine, as I said he's the audiophile but strangely doesn't mind the stock earbuds and didn't care what he ended up with.

I tried all the different size fittings, tried putting them in different ways (yes I tried a very deep tight fitting, still awful), tried different songs. I was in disbelief so I grabbed hubby and made him try them vs the vmodas, he agreed instantly that the vmodas were infinitely better. I did find if I gently (not pushing so much as just barely touching) held my finger tips to them when they were in that the sound was much better, but I'm not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears.

They work well on a plane where there's a steady low frequency drone from the engines, but they're bulky and after a couple of hours the squeezing pressure began to bother me.  I switched to a Sony in-ear noise suppression headset, which is small enough to fit in a pocket, but neither the sound nor the noise suppression came close to the Bose, probably because they didn't stay in my ears very well.So... in a never-ending effort to acquire more headsets, after reading a very positive review in the Wall St. Journal I bought the Etymotic HF2.  Unlike the Bose or Sony headsets, the HF2 delivers isolation rather than noise cancellation.  Therefore it doesn't need batteries to power the noise cancellation circuitry.  The earpieces fit tightly but comfortably into your ear canal and they block noise.  That means they work not just on a plane, but also in a noisy environment where there are sounds with mixed frequencies, not just the low frequency of aircraft engines.  The HF2 has the added advantage of having a microphone for taking calls on an iPhone, which is a nice bonus.  Your own voice sound kind of muffled and distant because of the noise isolation, but it's something I got used to easily. The mic has a button that allows you to take the call without fishing the phone out of your pocket.The package includes four types of fittings so you can get the best fit for your particular ears.  The Sony came with three types, but none of them gave as good a fit as the Etymotic.  That fit is very important with the HF2 because unless you get a good seal the noise isolation won't be as good and the sound won't either.  You have to insert them well into your ear.  You can order replacement fittings from Etymotic at a high price given that the fittings are little bits of molded plastic or die-cut foam.  According to the Wall St. Journal review, Etymotic is going to offer custom made fittings for an individual's ears.The sound is quite good (based on listening to a variety of MP3 recordings on an iPhone and to an audio download on my laptop.)  The base sounds aren't overwhelming but it's certainly OK and the higher frequencies are crystal clear.  The noise isolation is superb, and maybe this is the last headset I'll buy for plane travel at least for a while.The package also comes with a couple of replacement ear wax filters and pocketable zippered pouch that's better than a draw string pouch because it stays shut.  Two cautions: If you want to use these to sleep in a noisy environment, be aware that the ear pieces stick out of your ears, so it would be uncomfortable to sleep on your side.  Also, don't wear these when you are driving, or at least leave one ear open because you won't hear horns, sirens, or anything a passenger says or screams.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good sound; good fit, great noise isolation", "unixReviewTime": 1251417600, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2009"},

Are they uncomfortable, thinking that the mic won't pick up their voice, or are they compensating for a lackluster microphone?  If the latter, that will not be necessary with the Etymotic HF2 earphone headset, whose mic is every bit as strong as the one built into most phones, if not better.I tested this set with an Iphone 3G, and those on the other end were not able to guess that I was on a headset microphone rather than the Iphone's admittedly high-quality mic - that's a great compliment right there.  The mic, which hangs about three inches below the right earphone, seems to be able to filter out background noises, as well.  As for controls, it's simple - there's one button on rectangular microphone unit.  Press once to answer or hang up a call, twice to send a call to voicemail.As for sound quality of the headphones, they're fantastic, and that's no surprise given the pedigree associated with the Etymotic name.  I'm an Ety fan - I have a pair of Ety ER6i as well as their \"big brother\" the ER4P, and the sound quality of the HF2 ranks right around the ER6i, which should be excellent for most people.  Those not familiar with the \"Etymotic sound,\" it is extremely clean, and many may find it lacking in bass, but it is very true to the recorded sound, unlike many other cheaper (and sometimes similarly priced) earphones.  What you hear with Etymotics is a very accurate, if sometimes stark, representation of the sound that the artists captured.  They are not good headphones for those looking for huge bass response.  Those who enjoy jazz and great detail in their music might just love the Etymotic sound - they truly are an audiophile company.  And when it comes to calls, there's also a small thrill to be had that first time you talk to someone and hear them in stereo through these earphones if you've never experienced it before.  The world is blocked out due to the earphones' superior sound-dampening abilities, and the caller on the other end is extremely clear.A note about fit and sound quality: these in-ear 'phone are meant to seat deep in your ear, sealed with your ear canal.  When seated properly, they will deliver incredible sound quality and beautiful, solid bass - but not the deep, head-rattling bass you may be accustomed to from other head-and ear-phones.  If they aren't seated properly, wet the tip just slightly, insert, and then turn just a bit to get them \"snug down.\"  The fit shouldn't hurt, but may feel odd at first.  I found it took some getting used to and, yes, you will likely notice some earwax - you are, afterall, closing up your ears, so they will get warm.  Clean the triple-flange tips from time to time and make sure your ears are as clean as possible.  It sounds like a ritual, but it really is worth it for the extrmely high sound quality these earphones are capable of creating.Other small details: where the two wires for the earphones connect to join into one is a slider to sinch up the wires . . . I assume if you want them close to your neck?  Included on the wire is a clip that I found more annoying and cumbersome than useful.  Thoughtful, yes, but not easy to remove, and I feared damaging the wire sleeve in doing so, so it stayed put.  It simply made winding the wires up to put into the handy zipped leather pouch a job a little more clumsy than necessary.  Also included are foam tips and smaller triple-flange tips for the earphones, replacement filters, and a filter replacement tool.For owners of the first generation Iphone, the headphone jack is sized to fit into the recessed jack - no need for an awkward adapter.So why only four stars if I enjoy these so much?  (It would really be 4.5 stars if Amazon would let me offer it.)  I balk a little at paying almost the price of the 8gb Iphone for a mic/earphone headset, even as high-quality as this one is.  Another thing, and this is true of any headset, and so I don't mark this one down for it, your speaking voice does not come through the earphones.  Normally that's not such an issue, but when you are listening to the other party in stereo, and you can only hear yourself as if through plugged ears, it's a little disorienting, and I found myself fighting the urge to speak louder.  It would be nice if there were some way for your voice to be able to feedback into the earphones.Overall, however, these are fantastic - miles above most typical headsets, but the price reflects that, too.  If you spend a significant amount of time both listening to music and talking on your phone, and you truly treasure sound quality, these may make perfect sense.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Typical Etymotic sound quality, but a high price for a mic", "unixReviewTime": 1216857600, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2008"},

At first, I didn't look at the directions and just stuck the gray rubber ear piece end as far as it would go. Yow - that hurt. I thought to myself, \"Oh great, now you've done it, you've perforated your eardrum.\"But I didn't, and when I switched to the blue tip, and held my ear out as demonstrated, it went in perfectly.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic", "unixReviewTime": 1214784000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2008"},

However, it is important to note that they were a hundred dollars less and did not function as a hands-free headset either.Ease of use: These headphones were easy to install in my ear canal using the gray eartips (pictured).  There are six smaller blue eartips included as well as one set of foam eartips.  I pulled the top of my ear up (as indicated by the directions) and the eartip easily slid into the ear canal and sealed off all noise.Noise isolation: Remember when you were a kid and your sister was teasing you and you plugged your ears and said, \"I'm not listening!  I can't hear you! Ha, ha, ha ha !\" (I am sure there was a tongue sticking out too.)  These earphones gave me a flashback of those days.  When the music was off I could faintly hear my child standing in front of me talking, when the music was on (not loudly, but an appropriate level) I couldn't hear him scream... and he tried!  However, if you can remember back to being a kid you might remember that when you chewed or swallowed while plugging your ears you could hear every nuance of that sound.  This is true for the noise isolating headphones.  Of course the music will drown that out depending on your listening level.Sound Quality: WOW!  The sound is shocking!  You can hear every small detail and understand every word (which is typically a challenge with many singers)!  The sound is beautiful and was the way, I'm sure, the record company intended.  The bass was perfect for me.  It had enough \"bump\" for my tastes.  I am not one to drive down the street setting off car alarms with the bass bumping from my car BUT I also like a little extra bounce when I am working out to my music.  This is exactly where I found the bass to be, not flat, not headache inducing.Hands-Free Function: This portion of the headphones worked flawlessly.  I typically have a problem with headphones being too quiet.  Since these are noise isolating this is not a problem.  The microphone function is decent and while I typically like the microphone closer to my face, this headset is more of a \"headphones first\" \"headset second\" sort of device.While all of the above have been \"Pros\" the one \"Con\" I found: When using the HF2's with the Creative Zen V Plus the music would play, however, certain instruments and the vocals were lost.  It was like bad karaoke backup music.  By chance I pushed the send/end button on the headset and the music sprung to life.  When I let go, so did the vocals and various instruments.  I only had this problem with the Zen.  With my iPod and Zune there were no problems, only excellent sound.  Luckily the Zen belongs to a small child and I won't let him near my fabulous headphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "OH...So that's what music is supposed to sound like...", "unixReviewTime": 1215216000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2008"},

The HF2 still doesn't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear, but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good: Sadly at least on my BlackBerry, the microphone is terrible.  It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation.  The people I call tell me that I'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I'm in a quiet location.  Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside.  The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth.  I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it isn't twisted to point away.Then the terrible: I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone.  They never responded to my email.  I will try again, but so far I'm pretty disillusioned with the HF2.

Riley", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewText": "I had owned my Shure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones for over a year when I tried the Shure SE530PTH with Push-To-Hear Control.  The difference was so huge and I just had to have them.  I use them mostly on airplanes (six flight segments last week alone) and I have been very,very happy with my purchase.I recently got a chance to own the Etymotic Research HF2 earphones and I am very impressed.  Here I will compare them to both the Shure E4c (which retails at about the same price as the Etymotic HF2) and the much more expensive Shure SE530PTH (around $500).The first thing that I noticed was that the Etymotic is thinner and more compact that either of the Shure models that I own. While the Shure is more ergonomic, they require you to run the wire behind your ear in order to get the best fit (at least that is what I have found).  I use the memory-type foam ear pieces on all of the models that I reviewed; they just work better for me and give me a nice, tight fit.  I like the Etymotic case better.  Although it is bigger, it is a soft case versus the Shure hard case and you can carry extra ear pieces in Etymotic case.I listen to mostly classical, jazz and opera.  I started this test with musical pieces that I was very familiar which; music which I've heard both recorded and live many times over the years.  I first listened with some inexpensive earbuds, the kind that come included with iPods and other devices, then with the Shure E4c-n. The cheap set sounded like I was listening to the music from another room.  I could hear it and recognize all of familiar parts, you just don't get anything close to the live music experience that you do with better buds. All of the exciting parts seem muted and dull.  The Shure E4c-n made a huge difference.  The high notes sounded crisp and pure.  The violins sounded like the real violins that they were, not synthetically generated ones.  Oboes, clarinets and tenor saxes had a clear, sharp sound to them (by the way, I have tried the $60-150 earbuds and, at least for me, I wouldn't buy anything less that the Shure or the Etymotic $150-200 models). Bass drums, violins and guitars stood out, had texture and shook you a little.Next I tried the Etymotics.  I have to admit that I liked them better, and not by a little margin.  Tenors sounded more vibrant with the Etymotics as did jazz guitar rifts.  Bass was a little better with the Shures, but not by much.  Plus, the Etymotics have the mute and call-switching feature that makes them useful to iPhone users (I used an iPod Touch for my tests). They felt better and lighter in my ear.Finally I tried the SE530PTH.  Yes, they are better, but it takes a picky ear to hear justify the $300+ price differences.  Plus, the Shures have a device with a built in microphone that lets you listen to someone talking without needing to pull your earbuds out (although I don't use it with my set, it's too bulky). If you have an iPhone, the Etomotics are a better choice as they have phone-useful features that the Shure doesn't.If I had the Etymotics first, I might not have bought the Shure SE530PTH.  Still, I am glad that I have all of them and I will certainly recommend the Etymotic to friends who are looking for a great set in the under $200 price point.Shure SE530PTH Sound Isolating Earphones with Push-To-Hear ControlShure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones (Black)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great value with big features at this price point.", "unixReviewTime": 1214352000, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2008"},

I have this to say -- The sound is great.  Its gentle, reserved, quietly confident.  I feel like I'm hearing the album and not my headphones interpretation of the album.  There are no ear-piercing highs, no earth shattering lows drowning out the signal, just competent clear reproduction of what the artist intended.  The sound opens up a bit at higher volumes like most headphones/speakers if you want something a little more punchy -- but for me, low volume.Etymotic really stepped up their industrial design design with this product.  The packaging is beautiful and so is the product.Now the downside.  The plug is a little too big, and the microphone at twice the size would still be WAY too big.  It dangles uncomfortably.  Compared to the apple microphone it is ginormous.  Getting the plugs seated in your ear is also difficult and because of this it important to note that these are headphones for sitting.

{"reviewerID": "A2DKQQIZ793AV5", "asin": "B0012OP7HE", "reviewerName": "Twister", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I usually start with description of the package, but in this case I wanted to mention the actual mail box it came in with a distinct sticker stating their 30 years of Etymotic Research innovation. The box itself has a very premium feel and look that sets a nice tone for a product. After taking headphones out of the box, you can't help to notice how light they are - at 0.4 oz for headphones with eartips and in-line remote this is super light. You also get a premium soft pouch case, a shirt clip (a bit tough to remove from a cable though), a set of 3 additional eartips, and something very unique - a solid metal filter removal tool with 2 replaceable accu-filters that incorporate wax filters. Eartips are not your typical silicone domes you see with other brands. You get two pairs of triple-flange tips (in standard and small size), a pair of barrel foam tips, and a pair of mushroom shaped glider tips. Upon closer examination of headphones, you quickly realize why you need all these special tips. The pistol shape design of headphone has a very elongated ear piece that goes deep into your ear canal, thus a reference by some of calling HF2 headphones as canal-phones. Selection of eartips for these headphones is very crucial, you either get a premium audiophile sound or tiny stock earphone sound. I found foam tips to be too big, while gliders didn't stay secure in my ears although they were the most comfortable, and triple-flange were too uncomfortable although I probably going to use it later for my ear wax removal So what did I ended up with? I went back to my trusted Comply Foam tips. I had TSX100 handy which fits perfectly with these headphones. One word of advice since HF2 already has a filter with earwax guard, \"x\" model is an overkill since it has it's own earwax built in filter and HF2 earphone piece is long enough to pock it out, therefore TS100 model or T100 would be suited better.You do need to start with a proper burn in since these are armature drivers and out of the box you need to prep them to exercise the drivers (white/pink noise loop is the best for this task). A proper seal of your ear canal is the key to make HF2 shine, and I was successfully able to execute that with Comply tips. Once you get a perfect match - hold on to your seat because you are in for a real treat. The sound is VERY balanced, and by that I mean a super clean and transparent clarity throughout entire frequency range at all volume levels. I was able to focus on every detail of the sound, from warm and natural sounding low frequencies to a crystal clear and vibrant highs, and mids that very perfectly balanced in between without been too exaggerated or recessed. If you are looking for a \"fun\" signature sound with a typical v-shape EQ or if you are a basshead - these will not be for you unless you start tweaking the EQ. But if you want to appreciate the original content of the sound, if you care about the accuracy of how it's being delivered, and if you want to submerge yourself into one of the best passive noise isolation I have experienced - then by all means HF2 is for you. I quickly started to compare these to my other headphones, such as UE600 and S4A and M-Duo and quickly realized how far ahead they stand in sound quality. As crazy as it sounds, I actually compared these $99 (currently on sale at Amazon) to my $400 quad-armature driver UE900 and to my ears the mids and highs very pretty damn close. Of course, UE900 has 2 dedicated armature drivers for the bass only, and that's where it stands above HF2 but we are talking about headphones that cost 4x as much. I was also very pleased with a soundstage of HF2 where I felt precise placement of every instrument and it sounded very natural rather then too wide and exaggerated (even with crossfeed selected on my Neutron media player)..Without a doubt these have a superior sound quality, but it comes with a few additional surprise bonuses. I consider these to be audiophile quality headphones which often don't include in-line remote. In this case you get a very compact soft touch in-line remote with a single multi-function button and built in high quality mic. I found the remote to work perfect with my Note 2 and everything got executed as expected with a single button click to play/pause audio and video as well as pickup/hangup the call, double-click to skip next and triple-click to skip prev track, and long press to voice activate Google Now. I was very pleased with a distance of the in-line remote relative to my ear and how well it picked up my voice where people on the other end told me it sounds like I was talking right into the phone. Other important design details worth mentioning too. Earpieces have a very nice soft touch finish and a great strain relief which makes it very easy to handle these. Also, Kevlar-reinforced cables are tangle free and eliminate any microphonics effect. Furthermore, I really liked how it's 270 degree angled 3.5mm jack was easy to handle and protected cable from pulling. A special mentioning goes to included tool to remove accu-filter, something you would expect to be included with premium audiophile headphones at least twice the price. At first I thought that little filter was only used for its wax-guard, but after removing it and trying to listen without it - I definitely heard a difference where it sounded less harsh with a filter in. There is one more thing I would like to mention, and its AWARENESS! app provided by Etymotic to control a sound based on outside noise. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it to work on my Note 2, although I know it works fine on iDevices. Perhaps it's still a work in progress and I will update my review later once I test a working version.Overall, I want to say that I just found a pair of my next FAVORITE headphones, that's how strongly I feel about these. For $99 we are talking about audiophile quality headphones with a superior accuracy and a very impressive passive noise isolation. With a bonus of in-line remote with mic and replaceable filter and 2 year warranty the value goes up. Just don't expect heavy bass and make sure to invest into comfortable eartips and you have a pair of IEM that compare and surpass quality of others which cost twice as much. Also, I hope in a near future to have an opportunity to test one of their premium ER4 models. If the sound quality of HF series stands that high, I can't even imagine how much you can improve it further.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing audiophile quality at a fraction of the price!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"},

I had been eyeing it since I heard about it on a tech show. I finally decided to take the leap since my wife and I bought our house a year ago and I can't hear my cell phone ringing when I put it in another room or more commonly, forget to turn the ringer back on after coming home from work. My wife has had to reach me about important, time-sensitive matters numerous times and I checked my phone hours later to find I had missed about 10 calls from her. The device connects to up to 3 different phones at once, but since it is only my wife and I, we only use 2. Each line has a priority, so when dialing out, it will start by trying the phone in slot 1, then 2 and finally 3. If you don't want to dial out through line 1, then you can dial *2 or *3 and then dial normally and the gateway will dial out through the respectively connected phone (all explained in the instructions).  We both use the Blackberry 8330 Curve, which each use Bluetooth version 2.0. We keep our gateway in the bedroom since that is the most convenient place for us and we get a full strength tower signal throughout our house. There is a usefulness of placing it in a room that gets the best tower signal and then connecting your phone line from there (i.e. bedroom 1 gets no signal, but bedroom 2 gets great signal from the cell towers).You can connect your landline handsets to the gateway in 1 of 2 ways. The simplest method is to plug your phone right into the gateway and since most cordless phones come with multiple handsets, it's very easy to then disperse the extra handsets to convenient places throughout the house. The other method of landline connection involves disconnecting your home from the phone company and then plugging the gateway into any phone jack, which then gives all other phone jacks in your house a connection. I haven't been successful in accomplishing this method, but the telephone we have had 3 different handsets, so it was not a big issue. The disconnect process is not explained by the Xlink company (for liability reasons), but if you search for something like VOIP my house, you'll find it. It is the same process.Since we keep our phones in the same room (approx 6-8 feet) from the Xlink gateway, we have no sound quality problems. If we have our cell phones in a different room than the gateway however, there will be crackling & distortion until we put our cell phones closer to the gateway.One of the great features of this device is it allows my wife and I to be on the same cell phone line at the same time if we need to speak to the same person at the same time.There are a few quirks I've found, but don't really bother me and I still give it a 5 star rating.1.

I then heard about this type of technology that connected your home land phones with your cell phone.  Figured I would give it a try.  AWESOME!  Just unplug your land phone line from the wall and plug it into this bluetooth.  Turn your cell phone bluetooth on discoverable mode.  It connects to the Xlink easily and you're ready to go!  I read that you want the other version - the \"N\" version if you want to continue to use a land line phone service at the same time.  The only limitation of this unit the bluetooth technology.  All bluetooth devices need to be in a decent range of each other to connect.  My Xlink is in my kitchen.  I start to get a crackle on the line if the phone is ~30 feet away in my bedroom.  But anywhere within ~20 feet, the line is clear.  Thus I simply leave my phone in this general area.  When I want to make a call, I pick up any of the cordless phones I have that are connected to the base (there are 4), and I simply dial.  The phone uses the cell every time and makes the call.  When receiving a call, the cordless phone displays the caller ID without any problems.  This thing is GREAT.  Definitely no need for my regular phone service now...**** UPDATE **** UPDATE... WELL, after 6 months of use, my opinion on this has changed.  My review above still is valid... It links up just fine with your bluetooth enabled phone as I described and once linked, it works fine.  BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM... Imagine that you're relaxing by the TV and a phone call come in on your cell phone.  So you pick up YOUR CELL and answer and start talking.  30 seconds (or other random time) into your conversation, you realize that you cannot hear the other person now!  You look down and see that the phone is now connected to the Xlink.  You hopefully switch back quick enough before the person on the line gets upset and hangs up...OR you're coming home from work while talking on your cell phone and pull into the garage... and then the Xlink connects and you no longer have the conversation going on your cell.  You may be able to click over, but sometimes you don't realize that it has if you are the one talking.Well, this happened to myself and my wife so many times, that we eventually gave up and just TURNED THIS THING OFF.  I tried to keep using this for a while... but it became too frustrating!!!  I'm too far out of the return period... I wish I would have returned it when I could have.OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND MAY WORK WELL AT TIMES, BUT IT WILL BECOME FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IF YOU STILL PLAN TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE FOR A PORTION OF THE TIME.  IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS... YOU'LL LIKELY NEED TO SIMPLY PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN NEAR THE XLINK AND *ONLY USE YOUR HOME PHONES*.  Unfortunately my initial smart investment has failed and I'm out of luck.

But in the new house, there's always quirky spots (my signal is good at my desk, but my new cell phone doesn't realize I answered the call -wierd).  And some people reading this may have dead zones.  Enter the Xlink.I read about the Panasonic KX-TH1212B in Consumer Reports and saw how they liked it, and I always like Panasonic products.  But reading some of the reviews online here, I questioned if I may also experience issues.  I then read about the Dock-n-Talk, or whatever it's called, and a GE bluetooth link, but everyone kept swearing by the Xlink.The Xlink worked right out of the box.  I put the box at the cell phone chargers, where cell signal is perfect and issue free.  I plugged it up to my Panasonic cordless phones (I call them networked - where you have one plugged into jack and others one their charger but not plugged in wall throughout the house), and there have been no issues.When you have the cell phone past the 10ft range from box instructed, you will get some static.  Easy solution - move the cell phone into range.  I liked that I read you could plug up the box and firmware upgrade at no charge for future cell models.On my cordless handsets, I have numbers programmed, and the handset speaks those names.  If an unrecognized call comes in, then it shows up as 'Xlink BT', but I have no issue with that.

For two years, I went back and forth between my VOIP provider (AT&T; Callvantage) and Qwest DSL with no resolution.  But since AT&T; was pulling the plug on their VOIP service anyway, I tried Qwest VOIP.  Surely since VOIP and DSL were both being provided by the same company, they would get it sorted out.  40 hours of my time, two service visits, multiple hardware reconfigurations, multiple QoS setups; they really tried, but ultimately we both gave up.  Even though I had a really clean 3.0 mbps DSL line, somehow it could not support an acceptable phone conversation if anyone on my three computer network was doing anything- just clicking on a webpage was enough to break up the call.I was on the verge of giving up and going back to POTS when I happened across this in a VOIP forum.  I'm on a family plan with Verizon and get excellent signal coverage in my home, so I added a line, ported my VOIP number to it and used an older LG cell I had as a dedicated phone for the Xlink.  I have it sitting right next to the Xlink and have it plugged into its charger.  Works perfectly.  And costs me just $12/mo with taxes.  Another benefit is when we travel, we just bring the cell with us and can answer calls to our home phone as if we were there.  Sound quality has been generally excellent as long as you don't expect miracles- if you are talking to someone on another cell, you are going to have the quality of cell to cell as the best you can expect.  But cell to landline calls have been really clear (the LG I'm using has really robust call quality).One final comment to another reviewer, who hoped a future firmware upgrade would provide names on caller ID instead of saying XLink; you have to remember this device is limited to cell phone protocols- cell phones have never provided the names of the callers (unless they're in your phonebook).  And there's no consistent way to extract that info from your cell and display it on your home phones.  However, if you get a multi-handset portable phone like ones from Panasonic, AT&T; or Uniden, if the number calling is in their shared phonebook then you will see it on your caller ID.(I understated this device may be made by Siemens who has just brought out an identical device with their own name on it.  Since Xlink spent the money to pave the way for people to understand and benefit from this technology, I would like to suggest buyers continue to support them by buying their version.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent VOIP replacement", "unixReviewTime": 1263600000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2010"},

I can answer my cell phone on any one of them, wherever they are in the house, and the clarity and quality of the call is equal to answering my cell phone.  One major advantage is the comparatively better comfort of the landline handsets, which is more ergonomically designed.  Disadvantage, of course, is that moving around or going to a &#34;better&#34; location to improve signal quality does nothing when on the Bluetooth connected landline phone handset as the cell phone is what is getting the actual signal and is stationary.  All in all - I rate this as an excellent product but only gave it 4 stars because it can't work miracles and improve on what it has to work with (your existing cell service connection quality).  Although those lucky enough to have a crystal clear, solid cell connection at their home location would rate a 5 star review, most of us do not so a fair review - though not the shortcoming of the Xlink - is 4 stars, because having a cell service connection is contingent on its use.

Our setup is Xlink + Vtech DECT6 6-handset wireless system + 2 iPhones (4S & 5). The Xlink and Vtech base unit are set up in our kitchen where we get 2-3 bars consistently on AT&T.; We have our chargers right there too. Our 6 wireless handsets on the Vtech are working flawlessly with the Xlink. Set-up was a no-brainer. I upgraded the unit as instructed, via Windows PC, but others have said it wasn't necessary.I want to explain what's happening with Caller ID, because that was a concern for us. CallerID from AT&T; doesnt come thru on our wireless handsets like it (still) does on our iPhones. But if a caller is in our iPhone Contacts, we get the caller name and the number calling us on all 6 handsets on our system. If not, we get \"Xlink BT\" and the number. So when you get this device, it will force you to tidy up your Contacts and add numbers for people who call you but aren't in there.Call quality has been exactly the same on our home handsets as on our iPhones. No callers have said they were not hearing us well. Our phones quickly reconnect to the system, when we enter the garage. I've also noticed that our connect range seems to be at least 40 feet, but I havent tested the handset call quality at that distance.We love it that now we can voice dial via Siri from 8 phones instead of just our 2 iPhones. And I can even leave my cell in my purse near the base unit to make sure I don't forget to take it with me.We were paying $50 a month for our landline's nonstop telemarketer calls. The Xlink will pay for itself after the first month. Now there's no reason to keep a landline. If you have a security system, get cellular backup. You should have that anyway. It costs us more for monitoring, but is more secure. And you're not duplicating phone service, so that cell phone bill looks more reasonable.I highly recommend Xlink BT. If you already have decent cellular reception in your home or apartment, you won't be disappointed!UPDATE: Just a few days after I wrote the above, my iPhone 5 is not reconnecting with the Xlink when I come back into range. I have to knock a star off my review for that. Now I have to remember to reconnect it, but at least it's in a prominent place where I notice those blue lights. No similar problem with my husband's iPhone 4S. This may be due to the recent Apple iOS update, hard to tell.UPDATE 2: Now a couple days later and iPhone 5 is reconnecting right away with the Xlink after I come back home.

The benefits of having this type of display is that it uses less power, looks like printed text on paper (readable under direct sunlight), and offers extensive durability. For these reasons- the F3 has been labeled by some as the &#34;Zombie Accomplice Emergency Phone&#34;.However, in practice- I found that e-ink (the biggest selling point of the F3) can also be a hindrance. For example, to refresh the display for menus /text messages, there is a notable lag and a 'flicker' (used to wipe the screen and create the new image) - which can slow users down. Also, I found the battery life to be quite disappointing. Seeing that the phone had an e-ink screen, no camera, no Bluetooth, no games (only for calling and MMS)...- I was surprised to find the phone to only last roughly 4-5 days under moderate usage.Call quality itself is quite good, and the reception with T-Mobile's 2G network is more than acceptable.Note that this is a dual band (not quad band) phone, which means some countries may not support the device. Reception and battery info. are both smartly displayed on the upper region of the display (next to the earpiece to both sides). What's not so smart, though, is the UI. It's slightly clunky, and takes some time to learn all the icons and tricks. There's also no volume rocker, so changing the sound mid-call is more tedious than on normal phones.Otherwise, the backlight is readable in the dark, and the keypad is large/tactile to press. The phone is also quite lightweight and slim- making it easy to carry along with you.

My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone \"speaks\" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing \"3\" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in \"Voice Guidance\" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat.

If you are dumb enough to purchase the US version and expect it to work in France or whatever hell hole you visit, you deserve to lose the money.And to the other geniuses that complained about the manual...seriously, you needed a manual to operate this? anyone can operate this, it has voice prompts. and if the phone starts up in Spanish it gives you the option to change the language.The Motofone F3 is just a phone and text messenger. it uses an E-INK display, that you now are seeing in products like the Amazon Kindle and others, so the idiot who says \"it isn't color\" fails to notice the obvious.Great little phone. it makes phone calls and sends and receives text messages, and that's about it. it does have an alarm, and you can change the ringtone among 9 presets I believe. That's it. No camera, no organizer, no apps, no web, no touchscreen.battery life has been pretty decent, but what is awesome is the standby time. i rarely make calls and I get over a week on standby (in area with a strong signal). If you hold the phone by the bottom, the signal does not get lower.Only things i find wrong with the phone is that the keylock is useless, the keys for 911 are still active, so if you have it in a pants pocket and the volume isn't on off or vibrate you will hear the DTMF tones going off on every step. and you might accidently dial 911 in the process.The other thing is that i haven't found a car adapter yet for this thing.But everywhere I bring it people ask me about it and what it can do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's a phone", "unixReviewTime": 1279065600, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2010"},

A great value for the price, it's a durable, reliable phone, but it doesn't do much else.  I bought this to ride out the last two months in my AT&T; contract, and it has worked fine.I would rate at at 4 stars FOR THIS PRICE POINT.  At the price, my only real complaints are that I would like more characters on the screen and would like better support for handsfree.Pros:1) Price:  You will not be able to find an unlocked phone anywhere near this price.  If you did, it wouldn't be nearly as good at what it does.2) Durability: This phone is tough.  Not many moving parts, no fancy operating system, solid integrated keys.3) Phone: It makes phone calls well.  The sound is good, the reception is good, the speakerphone is good.  Its alarm and clock functions are fine, its internal phonebook is weak but functional, and it can text in an emergency.4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.Cons:1) Texting and phonebook are weak.  The phone's display is \"e-ink\", and is limited to 2 lines of 6 characters at a time. (It looks like you are reading a calculator).  If you don't mind scrolling through 12 letters at a time, it's possible to text, but it's not easy.  I wouldn't use this phone to send or receive texts except in an emergency.  Similarly, there is a basic phonebook, but once you store more than a few dozen numbers, it's hard to get much use out of it.2) Handsfree is limited.  The speakerphone is great.  Unfortunately, without bluetooth, you can't use wireless headsets, and even wireline headsets are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone/power jack.3) No other features.  No GPS.  No graphics.  No games.  No videos, MP3s, ringtone downloads, camera, or any of the other doodads we take for granted.Tips:1) Some people have complained that their phone won't activate touchtone menus.  My phone will activate touch-tone menus, but only in speakerphone mode.  When I'm not in speakerphone, menus won't recognize my tones.2) The documentation is minimal.  If you google, Motorola has a much better manual available for download, and there are also a number of unpublished programming codes.Update: According to exhaustive googling, the touch-tone problem can be fixed, temporarily, by pulling the battery for 10 seconds to reset the basic settings.  This has worked for me - from time to time, touch-tone stops working on automated menus.  Pulling the battery and resetting the phone gets it working again, at least for a while.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Basic, functional phone, but little else (plus touch-tone tip)", "unixReviewTime": 1262563200, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2010"},

However, I know I will rarely use it as a laser or flashlight.Although marketed for Apple products, there wasn't a Apple USB cable provided for me. The iTouch might break if I drop it. I wished there was some sort of cushion like rubber to protect it but I understand that rubber is an insulator and that may cause the battery to overheat. The minimalistic design looks great but it forces the user to read the manual to understand how to turn on the laser, flashlight, and the charge function. It takes a long time to recharge the iTorch to full capacity. I wouldn't buy this to use with an iPad or any other tablet. It's just not worth the charging times.Although I do not recommend the iTorch for a tablet, it is a sleek minimalistic backup battery that is perfect for phones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sleek, minimalistic, backup battery that is perfect for phones.", "unixReviewTime": 1349740800, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2012"},

I inventoried every thing and was thankful  that All of the parts were in it and not damaged.I read the instructions and then plugged in to charge.  I have several wall charges, however, I wanted to use some of my devices so I used my HP Mini, and my desktop.  It worked fine charging on those.  After an hour on each device I went ahead and charged into the wall to make sure it worked.  It was charged completely after two more hours.When I  got up I began using  the battery i used my iPhone 3, an iPhone 4, an iPad with retina display, a fifth generation iPod, a HP Mini notebook and the new Kendle 16 gig HD e reader.  How impressive it worked on every device I had.When I got up in the middle of the night I took the battery with me and used it's flashlight to go down the stairs.  The light worked.Pros:The directions in the Manual are easy to understand.  I like that it came with a carry pouch.  It fits into my purse or even in a pocket. It stayed charged for over twenty hours while running several devices. It was still charged when I went to bed.  The pointer worked great it has  good range.Cons:While the packing was adequate I think there should be some changes there.  When this was delivered to me it was opened and ripped in two places.  The flashlight wasn't so great.  The range of that light was very small, and it's light was not much help in the dark.I would recommend this product to anyone.  It works just as advertised.

It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2...At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever.BOTTOM  LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund.  I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it.

The hardware code written for this battery is perfectly written, when your phone is fully charged the charger shuts off so it doesn't drain the external battery unnecessarily. The only improvement I could see being made to the iTorch is that they could remove one or the other, either the LED flashlight or the laser pointer (maybe make two different models?). That way they could put their money into making a better laser pointer (It dissipates noticeably after about 20 feet) or a better LED flashlight. Other than that this is a perfect product!

I have been pleasantly surprised at how well this still holds a charge after all this time. It's hard to quantify how much capacity is still left as I've switched smartphones in that time, but it stills holds a charge well enough that I'm still completely satisfied with how well it works with my newer, more power-hungry smartphone. I usually use the IMP500 throughout the week as I often don't have a chance to charge my phone except while in transit (BTW, does anyone remember when phones could go on for days without charging them? Now I'm lucky to get ten hours with light/sporadic use). This has been essential for me in those instances, as I just plug my phone into the New Trent and throw both of them into my messenger/laptop bag.  Usually by the time I get to my destination, my phone was able to recharge enough from the New Trent to last me the rest of my day until I get home. Additionally, I travel internationally a fair amount and also have a lot of trouble sleeping on planes. Basically I try to do all that I can to escape the boredom on 15 to 18 hour flights and long layovers. This battery pack has been essential in helping me kill time during these trips. In the past, I had been afraid to use my phone while flying because I didn't want to arrive at my destination with a dead cell phone battery. Now I can use my phone to watch movies and play games as much as I want, because I always have the IMP500 to keep my phone topped off. I haven't done any scientific tests to see exactly how long it lasts...but so far I've been able to make it even on the longest of my trips (southeast Asia from the NY/NJ/PA area) with a practically fully charged cell phone (and again...I use my phone excessively while flying).Pros:- The capacity hasn't declined noticeably in almost two years (and it's possible that it hasn't declined at all).- It's pretty small. If you're going to carry it in a briefcase or a bag of some sort, it really won't add much heft at all. It may be a bit cumbersome to carry in a pants pocket with a cell phone though.- The power button has to be held down for a second before it turns on or off. This makes me feel comfortable that it won't accidentally turn off while I think it's charging my phone inside of my bag.- It comes with a ton of different plugs...chances are that no matter what type of cell phone you have, you'll be covered. Also, you can always just plug in any of your own USB cablesCons:- This isn't a big deal, but it charges with a non-standard USB cable so you'll have to make sure you don't misplace it. I think it would be nice if it charged with a micro USB cable, since those are a lot more common. The power cable that it comes with is retractable though, so that does make it nice and compact for storage at least.If you are in need of a battery pack to keep your devices going, I absolutely recommend the New Trent IMP500.

The following morning, I used it to re-charge my iPhone5 whose battery was only 50% charged and within one and a half hours it was fully charged after connecting to the iTorch IMP52D. The process was simple and extremely easy to execute and after the half-charge, the remaining power in the iTorch was still showing as high (three lit LED indicator lights).The additional red laser pointer and flashlight are both useful and very convenient additional features, and once the instructions on their use were read and understood, were both fairly easy to use. The storage pouch was also a nice addition and helped with storing and transporting the iTorch.I would give this product a 4.5 rating, with the 0.5 deduction from being a perfect 5.0 score being due to having to provide my own iPhone charging cable since one was not included due to a license issue, although two were included (one for Android smartphones and the other for a Samsung Galaxy).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "New Trent ITorch IMP52D (5200mAh)", "unixReviewTime": 1369353600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2013"},

I got the New Trent iFuel about a week ago and have already used it to recharge my iPhone 3GS three times, and the battery pack still looks like it has a full charge. I wish I'd had this the whole time I've had my phone! It's so nice being able to recharge my phone quickly without searching for an outlet or a spare computer.It comes with several cable adapters that look like you can use it with about any reasonably modern cell phone, so I love that I can probably also charge my mom's phone for her in a pinch. If you're charging your iPhone, you just use the USB cable that came with your phone (or iPod or whatever). To charge the actual battery pack, you use the retractable cable included with the iFuel, but you plug that into the little AC power charger/adapter that came with your iPhone or iPad. Super easy. (And also small and kinda cool-looking.)So far, I'm really pleased with the purchase. I realized after I bought it that for a little more money I could have gotten one that charges my iPad too, so if you have an iPad you might want to check that out. But seriously, anyone with an iPhone (which I LOVE), knows the batteries aren't great (especially if your phone has a little age on it), so this is something you probably need.

I like that I can be charging my android phone (Samsung Droid Charge) and using at the same time (internet/texting/talking on phone) and my power level continues to increase. I tend to usually bring this with me in my purse since it's smaller than my other backup chargers and I usually really need backup power for my smartphone since its battery life is quite poor (I can live if my tablet runs out of power); The iTorch also has the red laser pointer and LED flashlight as extra functions. I haven't really had to use but I like knowing I have those available without needing to pack extra items.Cons: The iTorch can easily be accidentally turned on while it is in my purse or pocket, which then wastes power. Hard to switch off since it switches to red laser pointer, which I often never need. So I have to make a couple attempts to turn it off completely. It also needs a separate cable for Samsung Galaxy Tablet (which is supplied in the package).Recommendations: Make the power button a little harder to turn on. I don't seem to have the same problem with my iDual external battery since it's a bigger button and needs a more deliberate push.Rating: Despite the minor cons, I still rate this product a 5/5. It's one of those \"I don't know how I ever lived without it before...\" kind-of-products. Like I said, I use this iTorch more than my iDual battery since it is sleeker and more form-fitting. I no longer have the \"oh gosh, what if my phone dies while I'm out?!\" anxiety that I used to face on longer outings away from a wall outlet and no longer need to bring my wall charger and stay tethered to a wall outlet either.Another big plus is that I am VERY VERY PLEASED with the customer service by NewTrent / idealpoint. I bought this iTorch and the iDual from Amazon and needed some customer service and they were always very prompt and polite and took care of my issues immediately.

I used it solely for my cell phone charging during this time. (A Nokia Lumia 920 / 2000 mAh Battery)Packaging - The box arrived safely and as I have witnessed in the pack New Trent's packing always gives the impression your getting a quality product. Plenty of product information and a flip out part to provide even more detail. Inside you will find  a plastic insert holding the battery and it's accessories and a product manual. In the case of the iTorch you get the battery, micro USB Cable, a Galaxy Tab Converter cable and a soft pouch to store everything in. The iTorch is charged via USB but can be charged on an AC wall adapter but it is not included.Looks and Quality - I charged the iTorch for it's first use via my PC Desktop USB. It took a couple hours to fully charge. The blue indicator lights will blink while charging and finally go solid once it's ready. The unit itself has a very nice feel and is very light in weight. The rounded edges and chrome trim give it a more upscale feel. The front of the device sports the New Trent logo, The single function/power button and 4 small blue LED lights for indicators. The leading sides and bottom are blank and the top houses a Single USB and One Micro USB (For Charging) and to each side houses the Red LED pointer and LED White light. The rear of the device shows New Trent Information and Capacity information including Input/Output voltage information along with your standard FCC Markings. This is really the perfect size for a person on the go who just needs to push their cell phone or device a little further for the day. At 5200 mAh this is enough to keep you going through your work day easily and the added pointer and led light can come in handy too especially in an office environment I would have no problems keeping this unit in my pocket or at my desk for when it's needed.  I own several of the larger New Trent batteries which have more weight and size to them. This one really is the perfect size for the office professional.Usage - The iTorch works as advertised but this is where my only issue comes in. To keep the device simple and elegant I understand the reason behind only placing one button but you are essentially controlling 3 functions with this device. (Charging, Laser Pointer and LED Light) A single tap of the button lights turns on the device for charging and shows the amount of charge by the number of lit LED's 1-4. After about 15 seconds the unit powers down automatically. To use the LED Laser Pointer you double tap the function button. Once to turn on the device and again to turn on the red laser. Another tap will turn the laser pointer back off and then the unit will power down itself. In order to use the White LED flashlight you need to hold the function button for 3-4 seconds while the unit is in its powered down state and to turn the flashlight off again you need to repeat the 3-4 seconds. Not a deal breaker by any means but possibly one additional function button to control the lights or change the single button to work with taps (1 Tap Power, 2 Taps Laser 3 Taps Flashlight) This would be a faster way to turn the unit on and off as needed.Overall this is a 5 star product and it really does walk right in the middle of needs.

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's small, effective, and well designed.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that, with the unsurprising exception of the iPad, I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Kindle Keyboard,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the aforementionediPad (First Generation) (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge two or three devices with just one New Trent fully charged battery. I was only able to charge my iPad to 61% of its full charge, but considering iPad's size this is still really impressive, and on par with all the other batteries of this capacity.To fully charge this battery it takes about four to five hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.This New Trent battery is beautifully designed and very compact. It's also fairly light, and overall very convenient and portable. It is probably the smallest and lightest external battery of this capacity that I've come across.The battery aslo includes a small LED and Laser lights. These can be turned on and off using just one power button that turns on the battery. This is a very efficient and ingenious design, but took me a bit to figure out all the various powering options. Laser makes this battery double as a presentation pointer, which is a very useful feature to have if presentations are a part of your work description.One issue that I have with this battery is that by relying on USB port for its charging you lose the convenience of being able to charge it by just plugging it into the wall power outlet. With the ubiquity of USB devices and stand-alone USB power supplies, this is much less of an issue than it would have been just a few years ago. I am perfectly happy with this method of charging, but if you anticipate having to primarily rely on power outlets in your personal or professional life, then you might want to reconsider getting this battery.Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with this battery charger. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time.***** Review product provided by the manufacturer. *****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Effective and Well Designed", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"},

As a road warrior who's always going, sometimes by foot, sometimes by plane, sometimes by public transit, and sometimes by car, it's always useful to have extra power with you on the go. When you're on the road and don't have access to a wall or car charger, or when you just need to be on the move, the iTorch is perfect. I've been a long-time user of the New Trent Power Pack (Model IMP500), but believe you can never have too much power, especially when others are always asking for a boost. I love both New Trent products, and my old device has saved my butt on more than one occasion. What I really like about the iTorch in particular is the added bonus of the laser pointer and flashlight. It may sound silly, but it's already come in handy several times. I try to minimize the clutter in my bag and therefore never have a flashlight on hand. There are times, however, when a little light can go a long way. As a professional, a laser pointer for presentations is great too, and not one that takes little expensive watch batteries. BUT, to focus on it's main purpose, the iTorch is compact, portable, and easy to handle. I utilized it last weekend and managed to go from Friday morning to Sunday night without ever needing to plug my iPhone 5 into a wall; I made it most of Friday on my initial charge, and added two days of typical use using the backup external portable battery. I could have gone longer. The iTorch is not the most powerful external battery, but it's also not the heaviest! This thing is light weight! While there are other products that might go further, this little guy can give you the boost you need (for your iPhone, iPod, iPad, Camera, Bluetooth, etc.). Note the iTorch does NOT come with a wall-wart to plug it in to recharge, BUT, it charges off a standard micro USB. I was please to find out the iTorch can charge off the plug and cable I use to charge my second generation Amazon Kindle and several other devices that use micro USB (one less charger to add to my collect). Sleek to handle and easy to use, it's a great investment to have on hand and will pay for itself the first time you can fully charge your phone while rushing in a cab to the airport, or even during a flight to an important business meeting. Now that I rely on my mobile tech for everything, I never go anywhere without a battery backup!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Never Leave Home Without It!", "unixReviewTime": 1365465600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013"},

I have very few complaints as well about this battery. I liked the versatility with a flashlight, laser pointer, and an external battery. I would have liked an easier way to access what you want. While it says in the manual how to access each of the lights or the battery, it does not work perfectly. The laser pointer works the best because its just a touch of the button. The LED light is the worst because you have to turn on the battery itself before you turn on the light. It just makes for a difficult and confusing experience. Maybe providing two buttons (one for the battery on/off, the other for the lights). This would just make for a better experience with the battery/light. The idea is great and I love it because it hits a large market for people who present with a laser pointer and travel. I also really like the design is great. To make it better (and anything better) I would try to make it thinner. I really like the way it fits in hand. FInally, the LED lights are spot on and work like they should. But one problem I just ran into is that I had 2 LED light is like your last 20% percent. When my battery hit 1 LED, the charger shut off. While I charged my iPhone 2 times from 30% and another iPhone from 27%-57%, I still would have liked to have more knowledge of how much battery I have left. With that being said, the battery still works perfectly and I love it. The fact that it comes with a pouch and other cords is great for the owner of the battery.Pros- battery life and how fast it charges- accessories (pouch and cords)- design- versatilityCons- misleading battery life- confusing button to turn things onAfter talking to a representative over email, he sent me this:The instruction on the manual definitely needs to be revised because the actual number of seconds in holding the power button for activating each mode is quite crucial. Here are the actual instruction(tested):Laser pointer on/off: one press of the power buttonBattery on/off: 3 second hold of the power button(letting go of power button at 3 second will turn off battery)LED flashlight: 5 second hold of the power button(in the process of turning on flashlight it does seems to turn on battery as well though)Also, from manual the blue LED indicator should be displayed as follow:1st LED: \"in use\" when plugged into your desire device & detects a charge2nd - 4th LED: \"low, med, & high\" power capacityHopefully this will clear up any confusion with the product for your future reference.This shows that the company is actively engaging their products and they can still maintain terrific customer service!!! wow!

It has gotten me out of a number of dying phone jams, as well as helping friends whose phones were dying.  One day, I took my iCarrier out of my purse and it disappeared.  I looked all over the house and couldn't find it.  I then decided to buy the iTorch, which is less money that the iCarrier, since I didn't want to give up hope on finding the iCarrier.  The iTorch is great.  It's small so it fits in my smaller purse, and charges my iPhone just as quickly as the iCarrier.  I haven't timed how long it takes to charge or how long the iTorch holds a charge, but it's usually a few days before I have to charge the iTorch.  I tend to plug my phone into it when the battery is low and carry it around that way until I get home and then charge my iPhone normally.  The LED light is a great option to have, and has helped me find things in the bottomless pit that is my purse.  The laser pointer is also good if you're giving a presentation, or just to annoy friends and cats.  I like having those options, since you never know when you may need a light.  About a week after getting the iTorch, I found the iCarrier hiding underneath a tablecloth.  For now, I use the iCarrier in my larger purse and the iTorch in my smaller purse, but I'm sure when my son gets home from college he will pilfer the iTorch as he is always running out of battery on his iPhone.

The charger cord is a retractable so I can stick it in my purse and it doesn't get wrapped around or start dragging. The cool thing about the cord is that you use it recharge the iTorch and then flip it and use the same cord to charge the phone/Bluetooth. It can charge a cell phone and a Bluetooth completely with one charge. Cons: it comes with 2 charger tips, which are about 1\" x \" and can easily be lost. It would be cool if there were a little storage drawer at the bottom of the device for the tips. It has a superfluous laser pointer, which I have not found a use for. Also, you can't just plug it in and assume your phone is charging - you have to click the button to start the charge. Strike that - you have to click AND HOLD the button to start the charge. If you just click it, the laser pointer will turn on, not the charger, and your co-workers will freak out because they don't know where that red light is coming from.

You can \"wake it up\" by plugging it into a charger momentarily. Then it will work again, until it stops again. I took a video of the battery not working, then plugging it in for one second, and then showing it working again. I will try to get an answer from the company.  Stay tuned.  I have dropped my rating to 3 stars in the mean time.My iPhone 3Gs needed a new battery.  I researched all the options and videos about how to replace it and decided that this product would satisfy my needs for now.  My internal battery lasts about 4 hours and then I have to plug this in to recharge it.  My battery has such little reserve that this product charges it in less than an hour.  Typically, I don't even have to use the phone during this time, but if I do, the cord is no problem to have connected.  I can charge my phone at least 3 times before I have to recharge this product.One peculiarity is that you can't charge the unit with a 30-pin (or Lightning) cord.  You must use the micro-USB cord supplied (or another one like it) and charge from any standard USB jack (computer or brick that you would use to charge the iPhone or iPod).  The reason is that the manufacturer would have had to pay license fees to Apple to use that jack, so instead they have one micro-USB jack to charge it from (power in) and another standard USB to connect to your phone (power out).  This doesn't bother me and it probably knocked a dollar off the price.  But, you do have to have that other connector handy to recharge this battery.Others complained that the unit wouldn't charge up fully.  I find that it will charge fine if you fully cycle it.  I don't recharge it when it's only partly discharged.  It has 4 status lights and I wait until only one light is showing to recharge it.  The unit will turn itself off after 30 seconds of no load, or you can turn it off manually after checking the status.  I have not tried to both charge it and use it at the same time, which some dongle-type external batteries encourage you to do, but it would be an awkward mess to have both cords attached.

This is a better solution than buying an extra battery since this will work regardless of the models.  Besides, replacing a battery is a lot of hassle.I liked the shape and how it fits in my hand. High quality look is a plus.  Pouch provides protection against scratches.  Light weight & small size makes it portable.

I'd rather not have flash & laser pointer if it can be cheaper.There seems to be some differences with the pictures on Amazon and the model I received.  Mine used all 4 LEDs to indicate battery level.  Power button is something I had to get used to (pressing 1 to charge, then another one to turn on laser pointer, another one to turn the laser pointer off; press & hold 2 seconds to turn power off; press & hold 3 seconds to turn on/off the flashlight).

Since it is portable, I rather it be tight than loose.iTorch provides 5V/1A output and is compatible with most phones (I used it on Note 2, DroidX, BlackBerry Bold, & iPhone4).  It also works with tablets, but tablets usually require 5V/2A input and takes longer with 5V/1A (1st gen Kindle Fire took over 4 hours to charge from 30%).  I tried with AC that provides 5V/1A output.  Difference was about 10 mins.  iTorch seems as nearly efficient as AC.It doesn't come with an AC for itself, but works with most of ACs & I have plenty of them.  My experience showed that it requires over 6hours to fully charge when it is nearly empty.  I wish it would charge a bit faster, but I typically charge over night while I am sleeping, so I don't have complain.  Charging iTorch via AC is faster (10-15mins) than via PC.DO NOT fully drain and DO NOT charge iTorch while charging phone (devices).  Both could damage iTorch and reduce its life.  Also charge fully before the 1st use.  I learned it from New Trent's website after I made those mistakes.  I also learned that iTorch shuts off automatically if it nearly fully drained, instead of waiting until it is fully drained. Regardless, I wish these were noted on the manual.Overall, I'm very happy with iTorch's performance and now I do not have to worry my phone running out of battery when I have to be out whole day.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Portable Charger to Keep You Going for the Whole Day & More", "unixReviewTime": 1363564800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2013"},

For my Galaxy Nexus, it lasts approximately two and a half charges for one full charge of the device. It's about the same for my iTouch 4th gen. I tested it with my kindle as well, and it charges it well and quickly. It pretty much charges anything you can plug into the outlet.... even if you use extensions. One thing I really like is that its output amperage (1000mA) is twice that of most computer USB outlets (which are 500 mA) and even a bit more than most AC wall chargers (which are 850mA). I suppose most people don't notice this, but this definitely makes a difference in charging time. That being said, I also went on a business trip to Alabama and tested it on the car drive over and back (since I didn't take a USB car charger) and it performed great and without fail despite being used while my phone was on navigation for at least an hour at a time. The two additional functions of having a Laser and LED light on the same easy use button are also great for utility, and the fact that the battery isn't turned on on first press means the battery wouldn't accidentally be turned on in a bag.

Charging time for my devices isn't noticeably slower than charging using the device's wall charger, which is great!* I was able to recharge my Galaxy Nexus 3 times (consecutive days), and the battery pack still had charge left in it (2 indicator LEDs were on, so approx. half the charge I think)* The battery pack recharges in a reasonable amount of time (6-7 hours based on my experience) - Note, I didn't discharge the battery pack completely (since it is supposed to be bad for Li Ion batteries)Note 1: I initially questioned the need for a laser pointer in this battery charger, but I actually had a presentation that I had to make a couple of days after I got this charger, and luckily, I happened to have the charger in my laptop case - perfect!

In a very dark area, it will be enough to light up a very limited area close to the eyes, but not more than that. Yes, a brighter LED would drain the battery (when used), but it may not be a bad idea to increase the light output to make it more useful (user will use the light only when needed)* The LED and laser pointer should have a timeout - just in case it is accidentally turned on while in a bag.

The manufacturer's website said the micro USB adapters would cost extra, so it was a nice bonus to see them included in both kits, but...Crappy Universal Adapter CablesThough I appreciate that the micro USB adapters were included free of charge, I don't like the extra length the adapters create.  Understandably, the manufacturer wanted a universal charging cable with interchangeable adapters to fit an array of devices.  Great concept, but in reality, the adapters stick out from the phone a good distance and are made of hard plastic so they aren't the least bit flexible -- and that's a serious design flaw.  It makes absolutely no sense to have a cool mobile device only to have a needlessly loooooooong adapter protruding from it.  It's pretty ridiculous actually, and kills the convenience of using any mobile device while connected to those universal cables.  Not to mention, the long protrusion can easily be bumped or tweaked and totally screw up the connector inside the phone.  Needless to say, I wouldn't be happy if a product designed to keep me charged up and on the go ends up damaging my new phone!The FixI decided the cables that came with the unit would be good for charging the IMP500 itself.  But I bought a separate retractable micro USB cable to connect the IMP500 to my phone.  The advantage of buying a separate cable is that it has the right connectors built in, so it's a lot shorter than the universal cable and adapters that came with the IMP500.  Retractable USB cables are cheap and come in various configurations, so no matter what device you have, I highly recommend you get the right cable you need and forget about using the one included with this kit.Do AC adapters come with this thing or not?!I'm not sure why there's such a discrepancy from one buyer to the next, but after reading some reviews that said AC chargers were not included, I was prepared for it to go either way.  Luckily, both kits I bought came with the AC charger, so I was happy about that.  And YES, I bought both of mine right here on Amazon and they were shipped by Amazon direct to me.Build Quality and Ease of UseThe battery pack itself is built quite well and looks great.  It's solid, feels good in the hand and is straightforward to use.  Just hold the button to turn it on, plug the USB connector into the battery, plug the other end into your phone, and you're good to go.  Compared to the battery in my phone, this IMP500 gives me almost 4x the power, which translates in to hours of calls, texting, surfing the web and whatever else the phone does.  Perfect for long outings and emergency situations!Bottom LineThis is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone with a smartphone that gobbles up battery power.  It's an absolute emergency essential and is barely the size of a deck of cards.  But having said that, I highly recommend buying the right cable for your phone and ditching the useless adapter plugs that are included with this kit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Build - Mine Came with Wall Chargers, Plus...", "unixReviewTime": 1269993600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2010"},

But all the function comes with a price - really lousy battery life. The darn thing drains like a sieve when I use wireless - which is a pain as that is often the fastest connection and offers the best flexibility when using all those fantastic Apps.So I started to hunt down external batteries - especially for those long flights when I was in the middle of an audio book or new series of TV shows and blimmpppp there goes the battery. The first one I tried cost me $80 and never got to a full charge on the Iphone, only giving me an additional 3 hours of battery- big whoop - I still couldn't make it overseas. I tried another that promised 20 hours but it actually drained the Iphone!!! So imagine my surprise to find this Tecyer that cost half the price and charges like a champ! It is a fast charge too. I can't say how long it lasts but I have gone past 25 hours using video and audio and it hasn't run out. It got me back and forth across the country, over to Germany and France and now I plan to take it to South America. I highly recommend this unit. It is slightly smaller than the Iphone and lighter, and because it doesn't connect directly onto the Iphone but through a cord I can keep the phone in its case.As for the Kindle - it has a great battery life, but it is great to have a backup should you forget to charge it. I read about this trick on a Kindle blog - and I bought the USB Sync Charge Cable (for Palm Zire 31 72 Tungsten E) and I now use this adapter cable to connect to the battery pack and it successfully charges my kindle!

As anyone who's been to CES knows, a single charge on a phone doesn't last the whole day.  I bought this product right before I left to use with my iPhone 5 (also a recent purchase).  My first impression taking it out of the box was how small and light it was.  I was expecting something bulky and heavy.  My next impression was how nice it looked.  Now I never heard of NewTrent before this and bought this simply because of the price and Amazon reviews so my expectations weren't high.  I charged it up the night before and towards the afternoon my iPhone was getting low and I plugged it in.  Worked like a charm.  Walking around about an hour let it charge up enough that I was satisfied.  I met up with a friend who also was running low from his phone and I charged his too.  This repeated the next 3 days.My friends are now going to buy this for themselves.Pros:1.  Small, light, portable and beautiful industrial design2.  4 blue LED lights make it easy to understand what's happening3.  Quick charging.4.  USB plug enables charging of any device5.

First, since I was on a formal tour, we would be out of range of electric outlets from 8-9 hours every day.  With this item, I did not have to worry about my iPhone (used for taking pictures and email) running out of juice.  The second reason was that some electronics can be a bit temperamental when charging them in other countries and can be easily fried/damaged.  With this item (I have 2 of these devices), I would charge this item via the local outlet then use it to charge my other devices.  If this device was fried, it was relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of an iPhone. Fortunately, this charger worked flawlessly.  In terms of size, while I generally carried it in my backpack, it was small/light enough to carry in the leg pocket of my cargo pants.  Nice!  This product is dual voltage so no transformer is required when traveling to Israel; only adapters. This product recharged within a reasonable amount of time and subsequently charged my electronics (iPhone, Blackberry, iPod Nano) fairly quickly.  The only annoying feature was the method by which the flashlight and laser pointer are turned on/off (X number of clicks to turn on and another X number of clicks to turn off).

For months, my friend brought his Energizer external battery pack to charge his iPhone, and friends' phones on our return home. The gadget person I am, I set out to purchase my own. However, reviews of the Energizer pack and other brands were not favorable, until I came across New Trent's products.I decided to buy the IMP500 for its great look (love the blue accents and rounded/bezeled edges/corners) and excellent reviews. It claims to charge a smartphone several times before running out of juice, and it was the right size for me to take on a backpacking trip.I took it on my 2-week trip to Peru: a 4-day Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu, and a 1-week stay at the Peruvian Amazon Forest lodge, Inca Terra, and was never once disappointed. It charged my Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone, and 2 iPod Touch devices.Comes with a cloth pouch to store the battery pack, but there was no way to include the charging cable without scratching the battery pack's glossy interior. Which now brings me to the biggest issue with the product:The charging cable is proprietary. One end is USB, and the other is proprietary. I wish it was micro-USB based on the proprietary end so that in the event I lose the charging cable, I could use my smartphone's cable.Another improvement suggestion would be to allow you to manually turn off the battery pack -- currently, you have to leave it on and let a timeout shut it off. Perhaps New Trent could allow the user to long-hold the power button to manually force shut off?With that said, a 2-device charging version came out weeks after I purchased the product, and seeing how well the IMP500 works, I wish that I would have bought the 2-device version instead. Either way, I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I may purchase the more powerful 11,000mAH sibling in the future (which also allows charging of tablets like the iPad), but have no need for it right now.UPDATE 1/8/2014: After 2 years, the product still works GREAT!

While understandable given the juice that it provides, the bulk ensure that I never carried it outside the hotel room.Along comes the IMP52D.  It does not provide as much power as the IM70D.  However, it is significantly smaller and, more importantly, small enough for me to think that I will be able to carry outside the hotel room.

Although I have several other devices,  I have not attempted to recharge them with this external battery.  With the iPhone, I've only used it a few times, but based off of my experiences thus far I can say I really like this product!Fully charged, the New Trent iTorch took my iPhone 5 from 17% to 100%.  The second time I used it, the iTorch recharged the iPhone from about 36% to 100%.  The third time, my phone was about 17% and the iTorch charged it to about 46% before the iTorch itself was drained.  Based off of this, it seems that the iTorch may charge my completely empty (0%) iPhone twice.Recharging the iTorch via wall charger (using a separate wall adapter to connect via USB cable) seems to take about 4+ hours, when it was completely drained. This seems to be a bit excessive, but I plan to just recharge the device at night, no big deal.I previously purchased the Mophie Juice Pack Air, which added so much bulk and weight to my phone and was a true pain to get off, which I did not like any of that and consequently returned.  The iTorch is not heavy at all.  One recommendation or nice addition would be if New Trent added a short charging cable to accompany the charger (similar to GO-TRONIX 3 in 1 USB 2.0 Connect to Lightning 8 Pin, Micro USB and apple 30 Pin Connector for iPhone 4 4S Samsung Galaxy Note 2 iPhone 5, iPad 4/Mini ipod touch 5G Nano 7th).  This may drive the cost up a tad, but it covers most any device type and would be beneficial as to not need to walk around with a cord that is longer than necessary when trying to travel / be mobile.

I received the IMP52D the day before I left for vacation so I had a chance to use it extensively for several days now.  I purchased the unit for it's generous 5200mAh capacity, competative price, attractive looks, and most of all from the experience I had with other NewTrent products I own.  I am a little bit of a mobile electronics junkie.  Never traveling withour my iPhone, iPad, laptop, and camera.  I also use electronic cigarettes which charge via usb chargers.  A backup battery or several backup batteries is a must.  I have tried several of them.  Because I wanted the flexability of charging several devices from different manafacturers I did not consider iphone or ipad cases that snap on and extend the battery of that specific device.First impressions when opening up the box was that it is smaller then what I expected.  It's over an inch shorter and over a 1/2 inch less wide then my iPhone 5.  It is a little bit thicker then the iPhone 5 with my Otterbox Defender case on it.  It's a very attractive unit.  Black of course with a chrome bezel around the front.  There's a single flush button on the front with four blue leds above it.  The flush button is nice as it prevent it from getting caught on something and accidently turned on.  There's a micro and regular usb ports on the top along with a laser pointer light and an led light.  The device can easily fit in a shirt or pand pocket and it rather light.  The unit appears very well built.  The package contained 2 usb cables.  One with a micro usb on one end and a regular usb on the other used for charging and android based phones.  The other is a Galaxy Tab charging cable. Also included were an instruction manual, and a nice drawstring pouch to keep it in.  The pouch is a nice addition to keep the attractive unit from getting banged up and scratched.  These devices are very simple to use and because I get excited with every new device I get in my hands started charging it right away.  I plugged the included micro usb into the IMP52D and the other into an Apple cube type usb/ac adapter.  The indicator lights show the charging progress with flashing and solid leds.  The solid led indicates the current level and the flashing one is the level it's working on.  Total initial charging time was 2.5 to 3 hours.  Note that the leftmost led only illuminates when the device it connected to (charging) another device.So far the device has charged everything I threw at it.  Charged my iPhone 5 without an issue.  Note to iPhone 5 users...if you recently got one or are waiting for yours a backup battery is a necessity.  I haven't figured if I could change some settings on it but it chews through the battery much faster then my iPhone 4 did (and the 3GS for that matter).  I've been using the maps app quite a bit so that may be the cause but it's really taxing the battery.  I was able to fully charge my iPhone 5 and also put a decent charge on my iPad 2 and charge one of my cigarette batteries.The included led flashlight and laser pointer are an added benifet as well.  Haven't had a chance to use the laser pointer other then to play with my dog (he loves chasing it on the floor) but the led flashlight already came in handy on a couple occasions.As far as product improvements there is nothing really major but would love to see the following.1. The user manual is sufficient but most functions are explained via pictures.  Including pictures and text would be better.2. The led flashlight could be stronger.3. A single button operates the laser pointer, the led flashlight, and turns the unit on and off.  Having separate buttons would be better.  I do not like having to hold buttons for different durations of time to turn features on and off.Separating the unit on light from the battery capacity lights (I would think most people think all 4 leds represent the battery life and when charging the unit the first one is off)Overall I think the unit is excellent and highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great and Versatile Backup Battery", "unixReviewTime": 1348790400, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2012"},

Why did it take me SOOOOOOO long to not get one earlier? Where was my head at!!I was attending a conference in Austin,TX a few weeks ago, I have a HTC EVO and I went through 2 batteries while I was there and still my EVO was burning up the battery. So, before my phone died, I started to research online about a battery  supply solution for my horrible HTC EVO draining device, when I came across the New Trent IMP500. I read the many 5 star reviews on this device and decided I MUST HAVE IT. Let me tell you.....I have now thought to myself how the HECK did I live without it!!!Since I bought my NewTrent device, my Uncle, my niece, my mom AND and girlfriends daughter all bought the IMP500! I have turned them ALL on to it.This NewTrent IMP500 device would definitely get 5 stars! Without a doubt. It is very new age looking, shiny black and blue cover, sturdy, along with a very simple, easily understood and has usable accessories. This is just FUN. It's fun to plug in your phone and then go out to eat and have your phone plug into its own source on the table your eating at. I did have someone ask me what that was the other day because they thought I was a serious user since I had my stuff plugged in at the table. What I told them was where the manufacturer of the cell phone company failed, NewTrent picks up and makes it better!
